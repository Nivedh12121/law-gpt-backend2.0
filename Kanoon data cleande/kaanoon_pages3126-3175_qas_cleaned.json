    "answer": "- There is no guidelines laid down by the government to forfeit the booking amount for the cancellation, and the deduction is done at the builder’s discretion.- Hence, legally, the builder cannot deduct any money out of the advance payment you have made for the booking till the time; a builder-buyer agreement is made and registered with the sub-registrar.- Further, A builder-buyer agreement is not created until the buyer pays at least 10 per cent of the property value.- Further, as per Real Estate Regulation Act , home-buyers can cancel allotment of the apartment booked with a builder at any stage even if there is no default on the part of the developer. The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amount.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions :the husband has sufficient means; and“neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself.Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.“While there is a tendency on the part of the wife to exaggerate her needs, there is a corresponding tendency by the husband to conceal his actual income.”If men cannot support themselves financially, they can claim maintenance from their wives who are financially well-off and earning more than them. This can be done under Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which mentions both husbands and wives as liable to making such a claim.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the CIRP petition of the flat buyers is admitted then a resolution professional will be appointed by the NCLT who will take over the management of the builder company and then devise revival plans for reviving the builder company by calling for proposals from intending builders or other entities who can complete the incomplete project. So all of this will be taken up in the resolution plan to be drawn and to be filed by the intending bidders and the committee of creditors [which will include the flat buyers also] would then have to admit and approve that resolution plan which best serves their interestYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Residential building project not being completed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Primarily, the word ‘delay’ means that a promoter/builder in the sale agreement has agreed to complete the project and give possession of the property within a period but has failed to do so.The RERA has the power to investigate a matter and issue notice on its own motion, as well as imprison the errant promoter.As per Section 31 of RERA, an aggrieved consumer may file a complaint with the Authority or adjudicating officer appointed under the legislation.\"RERA allows a homebuyer a choice of seeking either interest on delayed possession or a complete refund of the money paid along with interest thereon. And, if the builder fails to provide the desired compensation, severe penalties have been prescribed under the Act ranging from imprisonment to registration cancellation\".As per Section 18(1) of RERA, in the events where the promoter delays the possession of a property or fails to complete the project within the agreed time as mentioned in the sale agreement, he shall be liable to return the amount received from the buyer in respect of the apartment/property or plot, along with the due interest. The interest imposed is 10 percent of the amount invested by the buyer. In case of non-compliance, a builder might face imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years or a fine of up to 10 percent of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both.If the builder unilaterally changes the possession date of the project, then the buyer has a right to withdraw from the project and claim a refund of the invested amount within 45 days.If the buyer does not withdraw the possession of the apartment/property, he/she retains the right to be compensated for the delay in the form of monthly interest till the date of handover. The monthly interest would be paid at the rates prescribed under the legislation. The interest must be automatically initiated by the builder or the promoter when the delay commences.As per the ruling by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), buyers can seek a refund from the developer if the possession of the house or a flat is delayed beyond one year. Depending upon the value of the property, buyers can approach NCDRC in the following courts:For properties worth Rs 20 lakh, complaints should be filed with the District CommissionFor properties valued between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore, grievances should be listed with the State CommissionFor claims of over Rs 1 crore, a homebuyer should approach the National CommissionFor those home buyers whose residential projects have got stuck due to lack of funds with the developer, the announcement made by the government related to the funding of stalled projects has come out as a welcome relief. The Union Cabinet has recently approved the ‘Special Window for Funding Stalled Affordable and Middle-Income Housing Project’, wherein the government will be the Sponsor infusing up to Rs 10,000 crore into the projects.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As and when any party involved in the transaction realizes that incorrect information or typing errors are present in the property document, they should bring it to the notice of the other party involved in the transaction and get the mistake corrected, through the creation of a rectification deed.Under Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act,1963, it is provided that when any contract may be rectified:1. When there is a fraud or when there is a mutual mistake by both the parties. Now the person who is entitled for the rectification of instrument are as follows: –Either party or his representative can file.The plaintiff in any suit can file if any rights arising under the rectification of instruments.Defendants can file in any suit as mentioned in sub-clause (B).2. If in any case in which a contract or instrument is to be rectified under clause (1), the court finds that contract is done by fraud or by mutual mistake of the parties, then the court has discretionary power to rectify it.3. If parties claim for rectification and the court thinks fit, then it will be specifically enforced.4.

If the CIRP petition of the flat buyers is admitted then a resolution professional will be appointed by the NCLT who will take over the management of the builder company and then devise revival plans for reviving the builder company by calling for proposals from intending builders or other entities who can complete the incomplete project. So all of this will be taken up in the resolution plan to be drawn and to be filed by the intending bidders and the committee of creditors [which will include the flat buyers also] would then have to admit and approve that resolution plan which best serves their interestYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Primarily, the word ‘delay’ means that a promoter/builder in the sale agreement has agreed to complete the project and give possession of the property within a period but has failed to do so.The RERA has the power to investigate a matter and issue notice on its own motion, as well as imprison the errant promoter.As per Section 31 of RERA, an aggrieved consumer may file a complaint with the Authority or adjudicating officer appointed under the legislation.\"RERA allows a homebuyer a choice of seeking either interest on delayed possession or a complete refund of the money paid along with interest thereon. And, if the builder fails to provide the desired compensation, severe penalties have been prescribed under the Act ranging from imprisonment to registration cancellation\".As per Section 18(1) of RERA, in the events where the promoter delays the possession of a property or fails to complete the project within the agreed time as mentioned in the sale agreement, he shall be liable to return the amount received from the buyer in respect of the apartment/property or plot, along with the due interest. The interest imposed is 10 percent of the amount invested by the buyer. In case of non-compliance, a builder might face imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years or a fine of up to 10 percent of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both.If the builder unilaterally changes the possession date of the project, then the buyer has a right to withdraw from the project and claim a refund of the invested amount within 45 days.If the buyer does not withdraw the possession of the apartment/property, he/she retains the right to be compensated for the delay in the form of monthly interest till the date of handover. The monthly interest would be paid at the rates prescribed under the legislation. The interest must be automatically initiated by the builder or the promoter when the delay commences.As per the ruling by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), buyers can seek a refund from the developer if the possession of the house or a flat is delayed beyond one year. Depending upon the value of the property, buyers can approach NCDRC in the following courts:For properties worth Rs 20 lakh, complaints should be filed with the District CommissionFor properties valued between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore, grievances should be listed with the State CommissionFor claims of over Rs 1 crore, a homebuyer should approach the National CommissionFor those home buyers whose residential projects have got stuck due to lack of funds with the developer, the announcement made by the government related to the funding of stalled projects has come out as a welcome relief. The Union Cabinet has recently approved the ‘Special Window for Funding Stalled Affordable and Middle-Income Housing Project’, wherein the government will be the Sponsor infusing up to Rs 10,000 crore into the projects.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to get a Will done for property from father",
    "answer": "There are unregistered title documents in proof to title, there is dispute as to ownership and identity of properties. The  only problem is, documents are not registered and properties are not marked as per survey numbers. There is no difficulty in execution of will in respect to such properties. Refer the stamped sale deeds and ownership documents in the  will correlating with properties. Mention that as properties are already given to other sibling again making mention of ownership document and identity marks of properties therefore such sibling is excluded from any properties in the  will. Such wills are perfectly valid and legal. A will can be executed on any paper. It is executed on stamp paper so as not to create any doubt about date of execution of will. Will can be registered or un-registered. An un-registered will is as valid as registered will.  But if the will is registered, no stamp duty is charged on will, only registration fee has to be paid. But is safer to register will as that will rule out the doubt as to signature of testator/will maker. After drafting of will the testator/will maker has to sign the will in the presence of  two attesters/witnesses to the execution of will, the witness should state/endorse on the will that they saw the will maker signing the will. As no stamp duty is required for registration  of will, you have to pay only lawyer’s fee for drafting will, that will not be more than 20 K in any case. A beneficiary of will cannot be a witness to the execution  of will. A witness has to be a third party.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

If the CIRP petition of the flat buyers is admitted then a resolution professional will be appointed by the NCLT who will take over the management of the builder company and then devise revival plans for reviving the builder company by calling for proposals from intending builders or other entities who can complete the incomplete project.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Primarily, the word ‘delay’ means that a promoter/builder in the sale agreement has agreed to complete the project and give possession of the property within a period but has failed to do so.The RERA has the power to investigate a matter and issue notice on its own motion, as well as imprison the errant promoter.As per Section 31 of RERA, an aggrieved consumer may file a complaint with the Authority or adjudicating officer appointed under the legislation.\"RERA allows a homebuyer a choice of seeking either interest on delayed possession or a complete refund of the money paid along with interest thereon. And, if the builder fails to provide the desired compensation, severe penalties have been prescribed under the Act ranging from imprisonment to registration cancellation\".As per Section 18(1) of RERA, in the events where the promoter delays the possession of a property or fails to complete the project within the agreed time as mentioned in the sale agreement, he shall be liable to return the amount received from the buyer in respect of the apartment/property or plot, along with the due interest. The interest imposed is 10 percent of the amount invested by the buyer. In case of non-compliance, a builder might face imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years or a fine of up to 10 percent of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both.If the builder unilaterally changes the possession date of the project, then the buyer has a right to withdraw from the project and claim a refund of the invested amount within 45 days.If the buyer does not withdraw the possession of the apartment/property, he/she retains the right to be compensated for the delay in the form of monthly interest till the date of handover. The monthly interest would be paid at the rates prescribed under the legislation. The interest must be automatically initiated by the builder or the promoter when the delay commences.As per the ruling by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), buyers can seek a refund from the developer if the possession of the house or a flat is delayed beyond one year. Depending upon the value of the property, buyers can approach NCDRC in the following courts:For properties worth Rs 20 lakh, complaints should be filed with the District CommissionFor properties valued between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore, grievances should be listed with the State CommissionFor claims of over Rs 1 crore, a homebuyer should approach the National CommissionFor those home buyers whose residential projects have got stuck due to lack of funds with the developer, the announcement made by the government related to the funding of stalled projects has come out as a welcome relief. The Union Cabinet has recently approved the ‘Special Window for Funding Stalled Affordable and Middle-Income Housing Project’, wherein the government will be the Sponsor infusing up to Rs 10,000 crore into the projects.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In the case of a sole proprietary business concern, the proprietor and his business are one and the same.In case of death of the sole proprietor, his legal heirs can legally continue the business.a legal heir can transfer the ITC to a new entity in case of death of sole proprietor. In such a case, legal heir needs to get a new registration under GST and transfer the ITC through FORM GST ITC-02 to this new entity.Once the new registration is approved, Legal heir has to apply for the transfer of ITC by filing FORM GST ITC–02 to new entity. However, there is no restriction on filing of ITC-02 pre or post cancellation. It is an independent form and has no relation with cancellation of the sole proprietorship firm.In a sole proprietorship, when the business owner dies,the business is essentially concluded and all assets and debts pass through his estate. The sole proprietor's will can pass the business onto a certain beneficiary, but that creates a new sole proprietorship (or partnership if more than two beneficiaries).T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The amount of loan is based on several factors: borrower’s age, value of the property, current interest rates and the specific plan chosen. Generally speaking, the higher the age, higher the value of the home, the more money is available.The valuation of the residential property is done at periodic intervals and it shall be clearly specified to the borrowers upfront. The banks shall have the option to revise the periodic / lump sum amount at such frequency or intervals based on revaluation of property.When you take out a home loan, depending on the type of mortgage, you generally finance 80% of the home price. But the total cost of a mortgage isn't just the actual price tag on a home, it includes the interest you pay on the loan itself.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The  only problem is, documents are not registered and properties are not marked as per survey numbers. There is no difficulty in execution of will in respect to such properties. Refer the stamped sale deeds and ownership documents in the  will correlating with properties. Mention that as properties are already given to other sibling again making mention of ownership document and identity marks of properties therefore such sibling is excluded from any properties in the  will. Such wills are perfectly valid and legal. A will can be executed on any paper. It is executed on stamp paper so as not to create any doubt about date of execution of will. Will can be registered or un-registered. An un-registered will is as valid as registered will.  But if the will is registered, no stamp duty is charged on will, only registration fee has to be paid. But is safer to register will as that will rule out the doubt as to signature of testator/will maker. After drafting of will the testator/will maker has to sign the will in the presence of  two attesters/witnesses to the execution of will, the witness should state/endorse on the will that they saw the will maker signing the will. As no stamp duty is required for registration  of will, you have to pay only lawyer’s fee for drafting will, that will not be more than 20 K in any case. A beneficiary of will cannot be a witness to the execution  of will. A witness has to be a third party.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Indian law does not envisage a system of land/title registration. Instead, the concept of registration relates to deeds/documents under which title is transferred. Instruments/documents/transactions pertaining to the transfer of rights in land are required to be registered in accordance with the Registration Act,1908. Section 17 of the said Registration Act enlists various documents/deeds/instruments which must be mandatorily registered, and others are optionally registrable. The system of registration of documents is well defined in India, with robust and operational government machinery to register such documents and maintain records of such registration/documents.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You do not have to answer their such illegal and unlawful questions or allegations because once they accepted that it was an unregistered partition deed, then the said deed becomes invalid in the eyes of law, therefore the partition itself can be held as illegal and invalid. However even if it was a registered partition deed, since you being one of the shareholders, if you are excluded from the partition and allotment of your legitimate share in the property that were partitioned, you can claim your rightful share in the property through court of law.3. You do not have to challenge the recitals mad in the 1970 deed.  The properties subsequently discovered and found to be the family property, then you have full rights to claim your rightful share in them.Do not get misguided by any false or misguiding information in this regard, which may be spread to dissuade your claim in the property.4. You can mention that the sale done by the brothers which include your share in the property hence it is not binding on you therefore you are not required to pay stamp duty on them, however as far as the partition suit is concerned you may have to pay the court fee to the newly added property as per the court fee and suit valuation act of your state.5.

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To attain legal validity, a partition deed must be registered with the sub-registrar of the area in which the immovable asset is located. This is mandatory under Section 17 of the Indian registration Act, 1908. This means that the parties involved in the partition, will have to pay stamp duty charges (under the provisions of the Indian stamp Act, 1899) and registration charge, to get the partition deed registered.Partition of any property is subject to the laws of inheritance. This brings into picture inheritance laws governing property division among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. At the time of partition, the share of each member is determined, based on his entitlement under the applicable inheritance laws.In the case of common property the joint tenants or tenants-in-common, all of them are entitled to the said property and are entitled to enjoy the same. If one of them alone holds or occupies the entire property or part of it, his possession cannot be said unlawful. His physical possession is that of an owner of this own interest and also that of an agent as to the other co-owners. Therefore, the possession of one of the co-sharers is the possession of all of them. At the same time, it cannot be said that the person who has been in possession of the property is holding the property not only for himself but also in favour of other co-sharers. A co-sharer who is in possession of the property is also entitled to the enjoyment of the same. The possession of one of them is possession of all in the eye of law unless the person who has been in exclusive possession asserts his title in himself to the exclusion of the other co-sharer which may amount to ouster.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed has a error in area of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Execution of property documents is a complex process. Often, an error occurs in the process of execution of documents. It is always advisable to get these mistakes rectified at the earliest.These errors can be rectified through the execution of a supplementary document called rectification deed. Rectification deed is a document executed between parties to correct a mistake in the principal deed.There must have been a bona fide mistake where the original deed does not reflect the true intention of parties to the deed. The mistake should pertain to facts only. It should not be a mistake of law.The parties to the agreement must concur to modify the original agreement by addition, deletion or rectification of any terms referred to in the already executed deed. The parties need to reduce the correction into a duly executed document. Further, they need to pay the requisite stamp duty in order to get it registered with the specified authority.A rectification deed should be executed after mutual consent of all the parties to the main deed. All parties to the original deed should jointly execute the rectification deed as well.In case the original deed is registered, one should get the rectification deed also registered. And pay the requisite stamp duty and registration charges as per the laws in force in the State. In case the rectification deed relates to the area, the names of the parties or the extent of the property, the stamp duty and registration charges as applicable to the conveyance deed are payable.In case some of the parties to the agreement do not agree to such an amendment or rectification of the executed documents, the other party may file a suit before a court under Section 26 of Specific Relief Act 1963. The law provides for relief to parties in case the real intention of the party is not properly reflected in the documents executed because of a bona fide mistake of fact.The aggrieved party may institute a suit to have the deed rectified. The court can direct the rectification of an instrument, if it is satisfied that the deed does not express the real intention of the parties. This relief is entirely discretionary. The relief won't prejudice the rights acquired by a third party in good faith for value.It is to be noted that the mistake should pertain to facts only and should not be a mistake of law. Mistakes of law cannot be rectified through a rectification deed and a separate procedure needs to be followed.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to get a Will done for property from father",
    "answer": "There are unregistered title documents in proof to title, there is dispute as to ownership and identity of properties. The  only problem is, documents are not registered and properties are not marked as per survey numbers. There is no difficulty in execution of will in respect to such properties. Refer the stamped sale deeds and ownership documents in the  will correlating with properties. Mention that as properties are already given to other sibling again making mention of ownership document and identity marks of properties therefore such sibling is excluded from any properties in the  will. Such wills are perfectly valid and legal. A will can be executed on any paper. It is executed on stamp paper so as not to create any doubt about date of execution of will. Will can be registered or un-registered. An un-registered will is as valid as registered will.  But if the will is registered, no stamp duty is charged on will, only registration fee has to be paid. But is safer to register will as that will rule out the doubt as to signature of testator/will maker. After drafting of will the testator/will maker has to sign the will in the presence of  two attesters/witnesses to the execution of will, the witness should state/endorse on the will that they saw the will maker signing the will. As no stamp duty is required for registration  of will, you have to pay only lawyer’s fee for drafting will, that will not be more than 20 K in any case. A beneficiary of will cannot be a witness to the execution  of will. A witness has to be a third party.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

It is always advisable to get these mistakes rectified at the earliest.These errors can be rectified through the execution of a supplementary document called rectification deed. Rectification deed is a document executed between parties to correct a mistake in the principal deed.There must have been a bona fide mistake where the original deed does not reflect the true intention of parties to the deed. The mistake should pertain to facts only. It should not be a mistake of law.The parties to the agreement must concur to modify the original agreement by addition, deletion or rectification of any terms referred to in the already executed deed. The parties need to reduce the correction into a duly executed document.

The law provides for relief to parties in case the real intention of the party is not properly reflected in the documents executed because of a bona fide mistake of fact.The aggrieved party may institute a suit to have the deed rectified. The court can direct the rectification of an instrument, if it is satisfied that the deed does not express the real intention of the parties. This relief is entirely discretionary. The relief won't prejudice the rights acquired by a third party in good faith for value.It is to be noted that the mistake should pertain to facts only and should not be a mistake of law.

    "question": "Gift deed has a error in area of property",
    "answer": "If the lease deed provides for gifting of the property by the lessee to a third party, the gift deed is valid in law, if otherwise in order. Assuming such a provision exists, if the description of the property - with survey no., village name etc., boundaries and measurements are correctly stated in the gift deed, the incorrect mention of the extent alone shall not invalidate the gift deed. For any undervaluation, only the government has any legal recourse for recovery of the shortfall and not your siblings.

    "question": "How to get a Will done for property from father",
    "answer": "There are unregistered title documents in proof to title, there is dispute as to ownership and identity of properties. The  only problem is, documents are not registered and properties are not marked as per survey numbers. There is no difficulty in execution of will in respect to such properties. Refer the stamped sale deeds and ownership documents in the  will correlating with properties. Mention that as properties are already given to other sibling again making mention of ownership document and identity marks of properties therefore such sibling is excluded from any properties in the  will. Such wills are perfectly valid and legal. A will can be executed on any paper. It is executed on stamp paper so as not to create any doubt about date of execution of will. Will can be registered or un-registered. An un-registered will is as valid as registered will.  But if the will is registered, no stamp duty is charged on will, only registration fee has to be paid. But is safer to register will as that will rule out the doubt as to signature of testator/will maker. After drafting of will the testator/will maker has to sign the will in the presence of  two attesters/witnesses to the execution of will, the witness should state/endorse on the will that they saw the will maker signing the will. As no stamp duty is required for registration  of will, you have to pay only lawyer’s fee for drafting will, that will not be more than 20 K in any case. A beneficiary of will cannot be a witness to the execution  of will. A witness has to be a third party.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

You do not have to answer their such illegal and unlawful questions or allegations because once they accepted that it was an unregistered partition deed, then the said deed becomes invalid in the eyes of law, therefore the partition itself can be held as illegal and invalid. However even if it was a registered partition deed, since you being one of the shareholders, if you are excluded from the partition and allotment of your legitimate share in the property that were partitioned, you can claim your rightful share in the property through court of law.3. You do not have to challenge the recitals mad in the 1970 deed.  The properties subsequently discovered and found to be the family property, then you have full rights to claim your rightful share in them.Do not get misguided by any false or misguiding information in this regard, which may be spread to dissuade your claim in the property.4. You can mention that the sale done by the brothers which include your share in the property hence it is not binding on you therefore you are not required to pay stamp duty on them, however as far as the partition suit is concerned you may have to pay the court fee to the newly added property as per the court fee and suit valuation act of your state.5.

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To attain legal validity, a partition deed must be registered with the sub-registrar of the area in which the immovable asset is located. This is mandatory under Section 17 of the Indian registration Act, 1908. This means that the parties involved in the partition, will have to pay stamp duty charges (under the provisions of the Indian stamp Act, 1899) and registration charge, to get the partition deed registered.Partition of any property is subject to the laws of inheritance. This brings into picture inheritance laws governing property division among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. At the time of partition, the share of each member is determined, based on his entitlement under the applicable inheritance laws.In the case of common property the joint tenants or tenants-in-common, all of them are entitled to the said property and are entitled to enjoy the same. If one of them alone holds or occupies the entire property or part of it, his possession cannot be said unlawful. His physical possession is that of an owner of this own interest and also that of an agent as to the other co-owners. Therefore, the possession of one of the co-sharers is the possession of all of them. At the same time, it cannot be said that the person who has been in possession of the property is holding the property not only for himself but also in favour of other co-sharers. A co-sharer who is in possession of the property is also entitled to the enjoyment of the same. The possession of one of them is possession of all in the eye of law unless the person who has been in exclusive possession asserts his title in himself to the exclusion of the other co-sharer which may amount to ouster.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Assuming such a provision exists, if the description of the property - with survey no., village name etc., boundaries and measurements are correctly stated in the gift deed, the incorrect mention of the extent alone shall not invalidate the gift deed. For any undervaluation, only the government has any legal recourse for recovery of the shortfall and not your siblings. They cannot seek to invalidate the gift deed on this ground.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "answer": "There are unregistered title documents in proof to title, there is dispute as to ownership and identity of properties. The  only problem is, documents are not registered and properties are not marked as per survey numbers. There is no difficulty in execution of will in respect to such properties. Refer the stamped sale deeds and ownership documents in the  will correlating with properties. Mention that as properties are already given to other sibling again making mention of ownership document and identity marks of properties therefore such sibling is excluded from any properties in the  will. Such wills are perfectly valid and legal. A will can be executed on any paper. It is executed on stamp paper so as not to create any doubt about date of execution of will. Will can be registered or un-registered. An un-registered will is as valid as registered will.  But if the will is registered, no stamp duty is charged on will, only registration fee has to be paid. But is safer to register will as that will rule out the doubt as to signature of testator/will maker. After drafting of will the testator/will maker has to sign the will in the presence of  two attesters/witnesses to the execution of will, the witness should state/endorse on the will that they saw the will maker signing the will. As no stamp duty is required for registration  of will, you have to pay only lawyer’s fee for drafting will, that will not be more than 20 K in any case. A beneficiary of will cannot be a witness to the execution  of will. A witness has to be a third party.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "1. you have to pay court fee being proportionate to the share which you claim in the joint family properties. because a partition suit is for partition and separate possession. so defendant's objection is legally valid2. if that unregistered deed is not challenged then you can apply to the court for amending your plaint if the trial has not yet commenced in order to meet the defendant's objections3. not necessary because even after the 1970 deed, the parties can acquire properties to be treated as joint family property. however you can make an averment in your plaint that the 1970 deed did not cover all the joint family properties4. you have to seek a declaration that the sale deeds between your brothers and third parties is not binding on you. you will have to pay nominal court fee for seeking such a declaration.5. whether or not you are in possession is immaterial, since in a partition suit you will be asking for partition of the joint family properties by metes and bounds and for separate possession of your share for which you will have to pay the applicable court feeYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "1.a. If it is found that the  requisite court fee was not paid then you may be directed by the court to make good the Deficit court fee.You should understand the difference between court fee and the stamp duty, if court finds you that you are required to pay deficit court fee, you have to either pay it or your suit may be dismissed for the same reason.2. You do not have to answer their such illegal and unlawful questions or allegations because once they accepted that it was an unregistered partition deed, then the said deed becomes invalid in the eyes of law, therefore the partition itself can be held as illegal and invalid. However even if it was a registered partition deed, since you being one of the shareholders, if you are excluded from the partition and allotment of your legitimate share in the property that were partitioned, you can claim your rightful share in the property through court of law.3. You do not have to challenge the recitals mad in the 1970 deed.  The properties subsequently discovered and found to be the family property, then you have full rights to claim your rightful share in them.Do not get misguided by any false or misguiding information in this regard, which may be spread to dissuade your claim in the property.4. You can mention that the sale done by the brothers which include your share in the property hence it is not binding on you therefore you are not required to pay stamp duty on them, however as far as the partition suit is concerned you may have to pay the court fee to the newly added property as per the court fee and suit valuation act of your state.5. The mere mention of constructive possession will take care of all the issues.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To attain legal validity, a partition deed must be registered with the sub-registrar of the area in which the immovable asset is located. This is mandatory under Section 17 of the Indian registration Act, 1908. This means that the parties involved in the partition, will have to pay stamp duty charges (under the provisions of the Indian stamp Act, 1899) and registration charge, to get the partition deed registered.Partition of any property is subject to the laws of inheritance. This brings into picture inheritance laws governing property division among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. At the time of partition, the share of each member is determined, based on his entitlement under the applicable inheritance laws.In the case of common property the joint tenants or tenants-in-common, all of them are entitled to the said property and are entitled to enjoy the same. If one of them alone holds or occupies the entire property or part of it, his possession cannot be said unlawful. His physical possession is that of an owner of this own interest and also that of an agent as to the other co-owners. Therefore, the possession of one of the co-sharers is the possession of all of them. At the same time, it cannot be said that the person who has been in possession of the property is holding the property not only for himself but also in favour of other co-sharers. A co-sharer who is in possession of the property is also entitled to the enjoyment of the same. The possession of one of them is possession of all in the eye of law unless the person who has been in exclusive possession asserts his title in himself to the exclusion of the other co-sharer which may amount to ouster.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed has a error in area of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Execution of property documents is a complex process. Often, an error occurs in the process of execution of documents. It is always advisable to get these mistakes rectified at the earliest.These errors can be rectified through the execution of a supplementary document called rectification deed. Rectification deed is a document executed between parties to correct a mistake in the principal deed.There must have been a bona fide mistake where the original deed does not reflect the true intention of parties to the deed. The mistake should pertain to facts only. It should not be a mistake of law.The parties to the agreement must concur to modify the original agreement by addition, deletion or rectification of any terms referred to in the already executed deed. The parties need to reduce the correction into a duly executed document. Further, they need to pay the requisite stamp duty in order to get it registered with the specified authority.A rectification deed should be executed after mutual consent of all the parties to the main deed. All parties to the original deed should jointly execute the rectification deed as well.In case the original deed is registered, one should get the rectification deed also registered. And pay the requisite stamp duty and registration charges as per the laws in force in the State. In case the rectification deed relates to the area, the names of the parties or the extent of the property, the stamp duty and registration charges as applicable to the conveyance deed are payable.In case some of the parties to the agreement do not agree to such an amendment or rectification of the executed documents, the other party may file a suit before a court under Section 26 of Specific Relief Act 1963. The law provides for relief to parties in case the real intention of the party is not properly reflected in the documents executed because of a bona fide mistake of fact.The aggrieved party may institute a suit to have the deed rectified. The court can direct the rectification of an instrument, if it is satisfied that the deed does not express the real intention of the parties. This relief is entirely discretionary. The relief won't prejudice the rights acquired by a third party in good faith for value.It is to be noted that the mistake should pertain to facts only and should not be a mistake of law. Mistakes of law cannot be rectified through a rectification deed and a separate procedure needs to be followed.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If a partner has been deserted by the other, he/she can userestitution of conjugal rightsagainst the other partner. The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Once that's done, you're all set to get remarried.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A rent agreement provides tenancy for a short period, which is later renewed after the completion of the period. Generally, a landlord and a tenant make a rent agreement for a period of 11 months, with an option for a periodic renewal. Since the current Rent Control Act is largely in favour of tenants but only applies to lease agreements of at least 12 months, establishing an 11-month pact helps landlords to take pre-emptive measures for eviction. It is because of the archaic nature of this act that the new Model Tenancy Act 2019 has been recommended.As your rent agreement has expired, the concept of notice period also may not apply. Hence, it is perfectly lawful for the owner to ask the tenant to vacate the premises.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "How to respond to a divorce case filed by husband in USA",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If a partner has been deserted by the other, he/she can userestitution of conjugal rightsagainst the other partner. The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A rent agreement provides tenancy for a short period, which is later renewed after the completion of the period. Generally, a landlord and a tenant make a rent agreement for a period of 11 months, with an option for a periodic renewal. Since the current Rent Control Act is largely in favour of tenants but only applies to lease agreements of at least 12 months, establishing an 11-month pact helps landlords to take pre-emptive measures for eviction. It is because of the archaic nature of this act that the new Model Tenancy Act 2019 has been recommended.As your rent agreement has expired, the concept of notice period also may not apply. Hence, it is perfectly lawful for the owner to ask the tenant to vacate the premises.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Until and unless proper and prompt follow up action is taken by the bank, the stay cannot be vacated so soon, hence you may decide.3.

    "question": "Tenant",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A rent agreement provides tenancy for a short period, which is later renewed after the completion of the period. Generally, a landlord and a tenant make a rent agreement for a period of 11 months, with an option for a periodic renewal. Since the current Rent Control Act is largely in favour of tenants but only applies to lease agreements of at least 12 months, establishing an 11-month pact helps landlords to take pre-emptive measures for eviction. It is because of the archaic nature of this act that the new Model Tenancy Act 2019 has been recommended.As your rent agreement has expired, the concept of notice period also may not apply. Hence, it is perfectly lawful for the owner to ask the tenant to vacate the premises.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Forceful occupation of property in violation of lease deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 17 of the Registration Act, an arrangement between a tenant and a landlord that involves occupancy of the latter’s premises for a one-year period must be registered in the Sub-Registrar’s Office. Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use. You can also seek police help to throw out the tenant.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A rent agreement provides tenancy for a short period, which is later renewed after the completion of the period. Generally, a landlord and a tenant make a rent agreement for a period of 11 months, with an option for a periodic renewal. Since the current Rent Control Act is largely in favour of tenants but only applies to lease agreements of at least 12 months, establishing an 11-month pact helps landlords to take pre-emptive measures for eviction. It is because of the archaic nature of this act that the new Model Tenancy Act 2019 has been recommended.As your rent agreement has expired, the concept of notice period also may not apply. Hence, it is perfectly lawful for the owner to ask the tenant to vacate the premises.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Hindu couple residing/working in a foreign land ought to be governed by the matrimonial laws in force at that place. As a corollary, the decree of divorce granted by the foreign court should be valid.Indian courts were confronted with situations wherein Hindu couples married in India as per Hindu Law, settled in a foreign land, develop matrimonial disputes and approach a foreign court. This situation demanded the Indian courts to determine whether the decrees passed by the foreign court as a consequence of the matrimonial disputes between the Hindu couples settled abroad, had any efficacy in India.The non-applicant always has an option not to attend nor actively participate in the foreign court proceedings. This would be taken as, the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. This, however, does not mean that the non-applicant is not even required to be served in the foreign court proceedings. Non-service would amount to denial of opportunity to be heard.The non-applicant must be served with notice of the foreign court proceedings. Or else, the proceedings would be taken in law to be a nullity i.e. of no value in law. If this is a situation, Indian courts are likely to declare the entire foreign court proceedings as void.Adultery, as a rule, is proved by, based upon any one or more proofs as below –Circumstantial evidenceEvidence of non-access and birth of childrenContracting of venereal diseasesEvidence of visits to houses of ill reputeDecrees and admissions of parties which should generally be corroboratedThank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Hello,As for common grounds of divorce, you have cruelty, adultery, desertion/abandonment (two years in India; three in Texas) and unsoundness of mind. This is based on a comparison of section 13 of theHindu Marriage Actand chapter 6, subtitle C, title 1 of the Texas Family Code. As for my advice to you, please read on.First things first, you should strongly consider initiating divorce proceedings in India as opposed to Texas. This is based on the fact that you were married in India which continues to be your country of domicile and the jurisdiction with the closest contact with the dispute. TheHindu Marriage Actobviously governs you. More importantly, it is the jurisdiction that is likely to give you the most amount of grief if your wife sets her mind to it.You see, enforcing a Texan decree – even in case of a contested, “fault” divorce – could be very time consuming and difficult in India for you. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to resist any attempt by your wife to bring fresh divorce proceedings in Texas before or after an Indian decree in your favour (and she may never do that to begin with for myriad reasons). This opinion is based on a survey of Indian and Texan cases includingAshfaq v. Ashfaq, 467 S.W.3d 539 (Tex. App. 2015).Any attempt to initiate fresh proceedings in Texas after an Indian court has ordered the marriage dissolved should come unstuck. The wife will have to show either of two things: (1) Indian court did not have jurisdiction or (2) the divorce proceedings in India were attended by lack of due process. This is a very tall ask that your wife should have a very hard time with. The matter will in all likelihood be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. You will have to get an expert to depose in the Texan court as to the relevant contents of Indian law (as per Tex.R. Evid. 203).This is how the whole thing will play out:You will file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Acton the ground of mental cruelty among other things. If you have proof of actual adultery then that could be a ground in and of itself.You may or may not be able to convince your wife to part amicably during the pendency of said proceeding. If she comes around to your position, the matter will end there amicably.Otherwise you will eventually get your divorce (presuming you have enough evidence to sustain your petition).After the matter concludes in your favour she may not pursue the matter further – or at least not in Texas (on account of legal expenses, familiarity, etc.)If she initiates something in Texas you can have it thrown out on the ground of want of jurisdiction as described above.I will need to know more to give you more specific advice, including info relating to your current living arrangement and properties in Texas. Hope that answers your question. Follow-up questions welcome.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "1. Since it will be a contested  divorce and not amutual consent divorce, the decree of divorce to be passed by the USA Court will not be valid in India. You shall have to file a divorce suit in India also on the ground of cruelty submitting evidence in support of your allegation.2 to 4.  Even in case ofMutual Consent Divorcewhich has common ground to obtain the decree, you shall have to get the decree of divorce passed buy the Foreign Court validated by the concerned District Judge in India, So, no foreign decree will be considered as valid in India unless validated by the District Judge of your area in India for which you shall have to file an application before the said Judge.5. She will not have any power to force you to return to India. However, she can file a 498a case and for attending the criminal case your court presence will be required till it is waived by the Court against your application for the said waiver.6.  The time can not be foretold since  it might depend on how your wife's lawyer will play his part of the game. Ordinarily it might take around 2/3 years.7. When Criminal Case like FIR u/s498a will be pending, it might impact your immigration. You should lodge police complaint in USa and also India (through email) alleging her cruel act on you detailing the acts with evidence to keep the same on record which will be helpful for you in the long run for getting the FIR quashed by you from the appropriate High Court in India.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

This becomes all the more important as the Limitation Act is not applicable to Petitions under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Writ courts generally refuse to grant relief in cases where Writ Petitions are filed after long, unreasonable and inordinate delay. An important question therefore arises is that what is the reasonable time for filing a writ petition in the High Court from the date of arising of the cause of action or making a Representation.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If a partner has been deserted by the other, he/she can userestitution of conjugal rightsagainst the other partner. The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A gift deed must be executed out of love and affection towards the donee without any consideration in return.With regard to registering the said affidavit, the same would not be possible as there is a time frame within which one can register a document (the maximum time being eight months).Without affidavit, other legal instruments may not be considered valid or proving that they are valid would be much more difficult.Affidavits are useful beyond the courtroom as well.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to find my property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Land administration essentially involves recording, processing and dissemination of information about the ownership, value, and use of land. The system of land records management varies across states, depending on factors such as historical evolution and local traditions. Broadly, such information can be classified as details of the property (such as tax documents, rental documents), spatial records (such as maps, boundary limits), and transaction records (registered sale deeds). Today, land ownership can be determined through a set of documents. These include: (i) the record of rights (RoR), which captures details such as the name of the land holder, the number and size of the plot area, and revenue rate (for agricultural land), (ii) the registered sale deed to prove that the property has been sold from one person to the other, and the taxes on the sale have been paid, (iii) survey documents to record a property’s boundaries and area, and prove that the property is listed in government records, and (iv) property tax receipts.In December 2016, certain changes were made to DILRMP.As per the changes, survey or re-survey operations will be conducted only when the RoR, or field book or map are not available or are destroyed/ damaged/ outdated. Further, if there is a difference between the area recorded in both the documents, the area recorded in the RoR will prevail. The survey/ re-survey has to be done for each plot of land. Further, the government and each land owner must arrive at an agreement certifying that the owner is satisfied with the survey. This further necessitates the need to undertake surveys on a periodic basis to update information in cadastral maps. The Expert Committee on Land Titling (2014) had recommended that for a guaranteed titling system, it is essential that the spatial and textual records are integrated and unified, so that there is no gap between the two.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,When a couple married in India are seeking a divorce in the US, it will not be a simple process as the US lawyer needs to understand the basis of the Indian family system, which in itself is unique. Also, the US lawyer needs to know the various marriage laws in India as it is community-based. TheHindu Marriage Act, Muslim Marriage Act, Dowry Act, etc., are a few Acts that need a clear understanding before handling a case.Being a resident of the state is important.Indian couples can, no doubt, obtain a divorce in the US, but they need to fulfill the residency requirements.If one spouse lives in the US and the other in India, it is still possible to file for divorce in the US but according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian lawIndian couples married in India can initially get a limited dissolution and then the final dissolution in the US. To get a final dissolution, the grounds should be cruelty, desertion, adultery or divorce based on one year separate and apart.The benefits of limited dissolution are that the couple can make use of the health insurance of the other or get spousal support benefits until the final divorce in the US.Yes, Indian courts allow conference call attendence for NRI's on a special consideration.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce petition can be filed on any of the legal grounds in India. Once you have decided to move in the direction of divorce it is important that you are prepared for the path ahead. Basic knowledge of legal procedures is very important. You need to do your homework before filing for divorce. The pre- divorce preparations include:1. Going for marital counseling: There are various clinics and associations that offer marital counseling to help the couples decide whether the divorce is actually inevitable. Breaking the family is regarded as the last resort in Indian society. Thus you must try to understand whether the reason for your divorce is actually valid or can be avoided.2. Looking for a competent lawyer: Only a good lawyer can help you with the contemporary divorce laws. A lawyer is essential for taking you forward at the right track while you are fighting for divorce. It would be better if the lawyer is especially experienced in handling divorce cases. Also your comfort level with the lawyer should be good as you need to share your personal details with him.3. Planning your future: Now when you are going to get divorced, you need to plan about various issues like financial backup, shelter, child custody, and so on. All these will take time to settle down, so it’s better to plan everything in advance.The petition will be accepted after you show the evidence that you have been staying separately for 1 year. If there is no contact between you and your spouse for 7 years then the court will issue a divorce decree.After the parties file a joint petition, the court gives a time of 6 months to reconsider the option of divorce.If the parties do not withdraw the petition for divorce within the said period, the court grants the decree of divorce.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Hindu couple residing/working in a foreign land ought to be governed by the matrimonial laws in force at that place. As a corollary, the decree of divorce granted by the foreign court should be valid.Indian courts were confronted with situations wherein Hindu couples married in India as per Hindu Law, settled in a foreign land, develop matrimonial disputes and approach a foreign court. This situation demanded the Indian courts to determine whether the decrees passed by the foreign court as a consequence of the matrimonial disputes between the Hindu couples settled abroad, had any efficacy in India.The non-applicant always has an option not to attend nor actively participate in the foreign court proceedings. This would be taken as, the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. This, however, does not mean that the non-applicant is not even required to be served in the foreign court proceedings. Non-service would amount to denial of opportunity to be heard.The non-applicant must be served with notice of the foreign court proceedings. Or else, the proceedings would be taken in law to be a nullity i.e. of no value in law. If this is a situation, Indian courts are likely to declare the entire foreign court proceedings as void.Adultery, as a rule, is proved by, based upon any one or more proofs as below –Circumstantial evidenceEvidence of non-access and birth of childrenContracting of venereal diseasesEvidence of visits to houses of ill reputeDecrees and admissions of parties which should generally be corroboratedThank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Hello,As for common grounds of divorce, you have cruelty, adultery, desertion/abandonment (two years in India; three in Texas) and unsoundness of mind. This is based on a comparison of section 13 of theHindu Marriage Actand chapter 6, subtitle C, title 1 of the Texas Family Code. As for my advice to you, please read on.First things first, you should strongly consider initiating divorce proceedings in India as opposed to Texas. This is based on the fact that you were married in India which continues to be your country of domicile and the jurisdiction with the closest contact with the dispute. TheHindu Marriage Actobviously governs you. More importantly, it is the jurisdiction that is likely to give you the most amount of grief if your wife sets her mind to it.You see, enforcing a Texan decree – even in case of a contested, “fault” divorce – could be very time consuming and difficult in India for you. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to resist any attempt by your wife to bring fresh divorce proceedings in Texas before or after an Indian decree in your favour (and she may never do that to begin with for myriad reasons). This opinion is based on a survey of Indian and Texan cases includingAshfaq v. Ashfaq, 467 S.W.3d 539 (Tex. App. 2015).Any attempt to initiate fresh proceedings in Texas after an Indian court has ordered the marriage dissolved should come unstuck. The wife will have to show either of two things: (1) Indian court did not have jurisdiction or (2) the divorce proceedings in India were attended by lack of due process. This is a very tall ask that your wife should have a very hard time with. The matter will in all likelihood be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. You will have to get an expert to depose in the Texan court as to the relevant contents of Indian law (as per Tex.R. Evid. 203).This is how the whole thing will play out:You will file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Acton the ground of mental cruelty among other things. If you have proof of actual adultery then that could be a ground in and of itself.You may or may not be able to convince your wife to part amicably during the pendency of said proceeding. If she comes around to your position, the matter will end there amicably.Otherwise you will eventually get your divorce (presuming you have enough evidence to sustain your petition).After the matter concludes in your favour she may not pursue the matter further – or at least not in Texas (on account of legal expenses, familiarity, etc.)If she initiates something in Texas you can have it thrown out on the ground of want of jurisdiction as described above.I will need to know more to give you more specific advice, including info relating to your current living arrangement and properties in Texas. Hope that answers your question. Follow-up questions welcome.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "1. Since it will be a contested  divorce and not amutual consent divorce, the decree of divorce to be passed by the USA Court will not be valid in India. You shall have to file a divorce suit in India also on the ground of cruelty submitting evidence in support of your allegation.2 to 4.  Even in case ofMutual Consent Divorcewhich has common ground to obtain the decree, you shall have to get the decree of divorce passed buy the Foreign Court validated by the concerned District Judge in India, So, no foreign decree will be considered as valid in India unless validated by the District Judge of your area in India for which you shall have to file an application before the said Judge.5. She will not have any power to force you to return to India. However, she can file a 498a case and for attending the criminal case your court presence will be required till it is waived by the Court against your application for the said waiver.6.  The time can not be foretold since  it might depend on how your wife's lawyer will play his part of the game. Ordinarily it might take around 2/3 years.7. When Criminal Case like FIR u/s498a will be pending, it might impact your immigration. You should lodge police complaint in USa and also India (through email) alleging her cruel act on you detailing the acts with evidence to keep the same on record which will be helpful for you in the long run for getting the FIR quashed by you from the appropriate High Court in India.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

    "question": "My account freezed with telagana state police and not unfreezing despite contacting multiple times",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’).The purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being ‘disposed of’ or ‘destroyed’. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the ‘Processes to Compel the Production of Things’.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If a partner has been deserted by the other, he/she can userestitution of conjugal rightsagainst the other partner. The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use.

    "answer": "Dear Client,When a couple married in India are seeking a divorce in the US, it will not be a simple process as the US lawyer needs to understand the basis of the Indian family system, which in itself is unique. Also, the US lawyer needs to know the various marriage laws in India as it is community-based. TheHindu Marriage Act, Muslim Marriage Act, Dowry Act, etc., are a few Acts that need a clear understanding before handling a case.Being a resident of the state is important.Indian couples can, no doubt, obtain a divorce in the US, but they need to fulfill the residency requirements.If one spouse lives in the US and the other in India, it is still possible to file for divorce in the US but according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian lawIndian couples married in India can initially get a limited dissolution and then the final dissolution in the US. To get a final dissolution, the grounds should be cruelty, desertion, adultery or divorce based on one year separate and apart.The benefits of limited dissolution are that the couple can make use of the health insurance of the other or get spousal support benefits until the final divorce in the US.Yes, Indian courts allow conference call attendence for NRI's on a special consideration.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce petition can be filed on any of the legal grounds in India. Once you have decided to move in the direction of divorce it is important that you are prepared for the path ahead. Basic knowledge of legal procedures is very important. You need to do your homework before filing for divorce. The pre- divorce preparations include:1. Going for marital counseling: There are various clinics and associations that offer marital counseling to help the couples decide whether the divorce is actually inevitable. Breaking the family is regarded as the last resort in Indian society. Thus you must try to understand whether the reason for your divorce is actually valid or can be avoided.2. Looking for a competent lawyer: Only a good lawyer can help you with the contemporary divorce laws. A lawyer is essential for taking you forward at the right track while you are fighting for divorce. It would be better if the lawyer is especially experienced in handling divorce cases. Also your comfort level with the lawyer should be good as you need to share your personal details with him.3. Planning your future: Now when you are going to get divorced, you need to plan about various issues like financial backup, shelter, child custody, and so on. All these will take time to settle down, so it’s better to plan everything in advance.The petition will be accepted after you show the evidence that you have been staying separately for 1 year. If there is no contact between you and your spouse for 7 years then the court will issue a divorce decree.After the parties file a joint petition, the court gives a time of 6 months to reconsider the option of divorce.If the parties do not withdraw the petition for divorce within the said period, the court grants the decree of divorce.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Hindu couple residing/working in a foreign land ought to be governed by the matrimonial laws in force at that place. As a corollary, the decree of divorce granted by the foreign court should be valid.Indian courts were confronted with situations wherein Hindu couples married in India as per Hindu Law, settled in a foreign land, develop matrimonial disputes and approach a foreign court. This situation demanded the Indian courts to determine whether the decrees passed by the foreign court as a consequence of the matrimonial disputes between the Hindu couples settled abroad, had any efficacy in India.The non-applicant always has an option not to attend nor actively participate in the foreign court proceedings. This would be taken as, the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. This, however, does not mean that the non-applicant is not even required to be served in the foreign court proceedings. Non-service would amount to denial of opportunity to be heard.The non-applicant must be served with notice of the foreign court proceedings. Or else, the proceedings would be taken in law to be a nullity i.e. of no value in law. If this is a situation, Indian courts are likely to declare the entire foreign court proceedings as void.Adultery, as a rule, is proved by, based upon any one or more proofs as below –Circumstantial evidenceEvidence of non-access and birth of childrenContracting of venereal diseasesEvidence of visits to houses of ill reputeDecrees and admissions of parties which should generally be corroboratedThank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Hello,As for common grounds of divorce, you have cruelty, adultery, desertion/abandonment (two years in India; three in Texas) and unsoundness of mind. This is based on a comparison of section 13 of theHindu Marriage Actand chapter 6, subtitle C, title 1 of the Texas Family Code. As for my advice to you, please read on.First things first, you should strongly consider initiating divorce proceedings in India as opposed to Texas. This is based on the fact that you were married in India which continues to be your country of domicile and the jurisdiction with the closest contact with the dispute. TheHindu Marriage Actobviously governs you. More importantly, it is the jurisdiction that is likely to give you the most amount of grief if your wife sets her mind to it.You see, enforcing a Texan decree – even in case of a contested, “fault” divorce – could be very time consuming and difficult in India for you. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to resist any attempt by your wife to bring fresh divorce proceedings in Texas before or after an Indian decree in your favour (and she may never do that to begin with for myriad reasons). This opinion is based on a survey of Indian and Texan cases includingAshfaq v. Ashfaq, 467 S.W.3d 539 (Tex. App. 2015).Any attempt to initiate fresh proceedings in Texas after an Indian court has ordered the marriage dissolved should come unstuck. The wife will have to show either of two things: (1) Indian court did not have jurisdiction or (2) the divorce proceedings in India were attended by lack of due process. This is a very tall ask that your wife should have a very hard time with. The matter will in all likelihood be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. You will have to get an expert to depose in the Texan court as to the relevant contents of Indian law (as per Tex.R. Evid. 203).This is how the whole thing will play out:You will file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Acton the ground of mental cruelty among other things. If you have proof of actual adultery then that could be a ground in and of itself.You may or may not be able to convince your wife to part amicably during the pendency of said proceeding. If she comes around to your position, the matter will end there amicably.Otherwise you will eventually get your divorce (presuming you have enough evidence to sustain your petition).After the matter concludes in your favour she may not pursue the matter further – or at least not in Texas (on account of legal expenses, familiarity, etc.)If she initiates something in Texas you can have it thrown out on the ground of want of jurisdiction as described above.I will need to know more to give you more specific advice, including info relating to your current living arrangement and properties in Texas. Hope that answers your question. Follow-up questions welcome.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "1. Since it will be a contested  divorce and not amutual consent divorce, the decree of divorce to be passed by the USA Court will not be valid in India. You shall have to file a divorce suit in India also on the ground of cruelty submitting evidence in support of your allegation.2 to 4.  Even in case ofMutual Consent Divorcewhich has common ground to obtain the decree, you shall have to get the decree of divorce passed buy the Foreign Court validated by the concerned District Judge in India, So, no foreign decree will be considered as valid in India unless validated by the District Judge of your area in India for which you shall have to file an application before the said Judge.5. She will not have any power to force you to return to India. However, she can file a 498a case and for attending the criminal case your court presence will be required till it is waived by the Court against your application for the said waiver.6.  The time can not be foretold since  it might depend on how your wife's lawyer will play his part of the game. Ordinarily it might take around 2/3 years.7. When Criminal Case like FIR u/s498a will be pending, it might impact your immigration. You should lodge police complaint in USa and also India (through email) alleging her cruel act on you detailing the acts with evidence to keep the same on record which will be helpful for you in the long run for getting the FIR quashed by you from the appropriate High Court in India.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

    "question": "My account freezed with telagana state police and not unfreezing despite contacting multiple times",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’).The purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being ‘disposed of’ or ‘destroyed’. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the ‘Processes to Compel the Production of Things’.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The top court then disposed of the transfer petition, while recording the terms of the settlement.Both the parties hereto confirm and declare that they have, voluntarily and of their own free will have decided not to live together as husband and wife and have arrived at this Settlement in the presence of the Mediator.The parties shall jointly request and pray fordivorce by mutual consentunder Article 142 of theConstitution of Indiabefore Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.In case the Hon'ble Supreme Court grants divorce under Article 142 of theConstitution of India, the second party shall pay an amount to the First Party in her name by way of Electronic Modes as full and final settlement on account of her stridhan, maintenance, alimony and future. This amount to be paid by the Second Party to the First Party.Virtual mediation uses platforms such as Zoom to create a virtual conference room so that both you and your spouse, and your respective attorneys, can see and interact with the mediator. The mediator will also have the ability to set up break out rooms where you and your attorney can discuss issues privately with the mediator.Virtual mediation is efficient and cost effective. Your mediator will be prepared to discuss the specific issues that need to be resolved in your matter, instead of you waiting at a courthouse for your case to be taken by a Judge with a full calendar of other cases to hear. Your mediator will be dedicated only to you and your needs.The Conditions required under section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 (‘HMA’)  are as follows:The husband and wife have been living separately for one year or more.That they are unable to live together.Moreover, both husband and wife have been mutually agreed that the marriage has collapsed; hence marriage should be dissolved.

    "answer": "Hello,The fact is that even if your brother is not contributing anything to the expenses on the family, his share of 25% will continue to be his even after construction of the house on the loan you have availed as your father has transferred it to him.Therefore, of you want to take that away from him you will need his consent in the form of a registered transfer on your favour in the firm of a Gift Deed, Sale Deed or  Relinquishment Deed. You may purchase his share, if he sells it to you at a reasonable price. The reason for your consideration to do so now is that after you have finished construction, your loss would be much greater comparatively.Likewise it is advisable that you get your mother's verba assurance converted to a registered document of transfer in your favour, may be through a Gift Deed.S J MathewAdvocate, Mumbai3603 Answers175 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate S J Mathew"

    "question": "Forceful occupation of property in violation of lease deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 17 of the Registration Act, an arrangement between a tenant and a landlord that involves occupancy of the latter’s premises for a one-year period must be registered in the Sub-Registrar’s Office. Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use. You can also seek police help to throw out the tenant.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To get a final dissolution, the grounds should be cruelty, desertion, adultery or divorce based on one year separate and apart.The benefits of limited dissolution are that the couple can make use of the health insurance of the other or get spousal support benefits until the final divorce in the US.Yes, Indian courts allow conference call attendence for NRI's on a special consideration.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce petition can be filed on any of the legal grounds in India. Once you have decided to move in the direction of divorce it is important that you are prepared for the path ahead. Basic knowledge of legal procedures is very important. You need to do your homework before filing for divorce. The pre- divorce preparations include:1. Going for marital counseling: There are various clinics and associations that offer marital counseling to help the couples decide whether the divorce is actually inevitable. Breaking the family is regarded as the last resort in Indian society. Thus you must try to understand whether the reason for your divorce is actually valid or can be avoided.2. Looking for a competent lawyer: Only a good lawyer can help you with the contemporary divorce laws. A lawyer is essential for taking you forward at the right track while you are fighting for divorce. It would be better if the lawyer is especially experienced in handling divorce cases. Also your comfort level with the lawyer should be good as you need to share your personal details with him.3. Planning your future: Now when you are going to get divorced, you need to plan about various issues like financial backup, shelter, child custody, and so on. All these will take time to settle down, so it’s better to plan everything in advance.The petition will be accepted after you show the evidence that you have been staying separately for 1 year. If there is no contact between you and your spouse for 7 years then the court will issue a divorce decree.After the parties file a joint petition, the court gives a time of 6 months to reconsider the option of divorce.If the parties do not withdraw the petition for divorce within the said period, the court grants the decree of divorce.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Hindu couple residing/working in a foreign land ought to be governed by the matrimonial laws in force at that place. As a corollary, the decree of divorce granted by the foreign court should be valid.Indian courts were confronted with situations wherein Hindu couples married in India as per Hindu Law, settled in a foreign land, develop matrimonial disputes and approach a foreign court. This situation demanded the Indian courts to determine whether the decrees passed by the foreign court as a consequence of the matrimonial disputes between the Hindu couples settled abroad, had any efficacy in India.The non-applicant always has an option not to attend nor actively participate in the foreign court proceedings. This would be taken as, the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. This, however, does not mean that the non-applicant is not even required to be served in the foreign court proceedings. Non-service would amount to denial of opportunity to be heard.The non-applicant must be served with notice of the foreign court proceedings. Or else, the proceedings would be taken in law to be a nullity i.e. of no value in law. If this is a situation, Indian courts are likely to declare the entire foreign court proceedings as void.Adultery, as a rule, is proved by, based upon any one or more proofs as below –Circumstantial evidenceEvidence of non-access and birth of childrenContracting of venereal diseasesEvidence of visits to houses of ill reputeDecrees and admissions of parties which should generally be corroboratedThank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Hello,As for common grounds of divorce, you have cruelty, adultery, desertion/abandonment (two years in India; three in Texas) and unsoundness of mind. This is based on a comparison of section 13 of theHindu Marriage Actand chapter 6, subtitle C, title 1 of the Texas Family Code. As for my advice to you, please read on.First things first, you should strongly consider initiating divorce proceedings in India as opposed to Texas. This is based on the fact that you were married in India which continues to be your country of domicile and the jurisdiction with the closest contact with the dispute. TheHindu Marriage Actobviously governs you. More importantly, it is the jurisdiction that is likely to give you the most amount of grief if your wife sets her mind to it.You see, enforcing a Texan decree – even in case of a contested, “fault” divorce – could be very time consuming and difficult in India for you. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to resist any attempt by your wife to bring fresh divorce proceedings in Texas before or after an Indian decree in your favour (and she may never do that to begin with for myriad reasons). This opinion is based on a survey of Indian and Texan cases includingAshfaq v. Ashfaq, 467 S.W.3d 539 (Tex. App. 2015).Any attempt to initiate fresh proceedings in Texas after an Indian court has ordered the marriage dissolved should come unstuck. The wife will have to show either of two things: (1) Indian court did not have jurisdiction or (2) the divorce proceedings in India were attended by lack of due process. This is a very tall ask that your wife should have a very hard time with. The matter will in all likelihood be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. You will have to get an expert to depose in the Texan court as to the relevant contents of Indian law (as per Tex.R. Evid. 203).This is how the whole thing will play out:You will file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Acton the ground of mental cruelty among other things. If you have proof of actual adultery then that could be a ground in and of itself.You may or may not be able to convince your wife to part amicably during the pendency of said proceeding. If she comes around to your position, the matter will end there amicably.Otherwise you will eventually get your divorce (presuming you have enough evidence to sustain your petition).After the matter concludes in your favour she may not pursue the matter further – or at least not in Texas (on account of legal expenses, familiarity, etc.)If she initiates something in Texas you can have it thrown out on the ground of want of jurisdiction as described above.I will need to know more to give you more specific advice, including info relating to your current living arrangement and properties in Texas. Hope that answers your question. Follow-up questions welcome.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "My account freezed with telagana state police and not unfreezing despite contacting multiple times",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’).The purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being ‘disposed of’ or ‘destroyed’. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the ‘Processes to Compel the Production of Things’.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You may purchase his share, if he sells it to you at a reasonable price. The reason for your consideration to do so now is that after you have finished construction, your loss would be much greater comparatively.Likewise it is advisable that you get your mother's verba assurance converted to a registered document of transfer in your favour, may be through a Gift Deed.S J MathewAdvocate, Mumbai3603 Answers175 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate S J Mathew"

Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce petition can be filed on any of the legal grounds in India. Once you have decided to move in the direction of divorce it is important that you are prepared for the path ahead. Basic knowledge of legal procedures is very important. You need to do your homework before filing for divorce. The pre- divorce preparations include:1. Going for marital counseling: There are various clinics and associations that offer marital counseling to help the couples decide whether the divorce is actually inevitable. Breaking the family is regarded as the last resort in Indian society. Thus you must try to understand whether the reason for your divorce is actually valid or can be avoided.2. Looking for a competent lawyer: Only a good lawyer can help you with the contemporary divorce laws. A lawyer is essential for taking you forward at the right track while you are fighting for divorce. It would be better if the lawyer is especially experienced in handling divorce cases. Also your comfort level with the lawyer should be good as you need to share your personal details with him.3. Planning your future: Now when you are going to get divorced, you need to plan about various issues like financial backup, shelter, child custody, and so on. All these will take time to settle down, so it’s better to plan everything in advance.The petition will be accepted after you show the evidence that you have been staying separately for 1 year. If there is no contact between you and your spouse for 7 years then the court will issue a divorce decree.After the parties file a joint petition, the court gives a time of 6 months to reconsider the option of divorce.If the parties do not withdraw the petition for divorce within the said period, the court grants the decree of divorce.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court of India (SC) on Tuesday ruled that an amendment to the Benami Act that came into effect on November 1, 2016, cannot be applied retrospectively to the transactions between September 5, 1988, and October 25, 2016.The apex court also declared section 3 of the amendment act unconstitutional. The section provided a three-year jail term and a penalty for people involved in such transactions.\"There is no doubt that the unamended 1988 Act tried to create a strict liability offence and allowed separate acquisition of benami property. This begs the question whether such a criminal provision, which the State now intends to make use of, in order to confiscate properties after 28 years of dormancy, could have existed in the books of law. Other than the abuse and unfairness such exercise intends to bring about, there is a larger constitutional question about existence of such strict provisions without adequate safeguards,\" said the SC bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana.(Prohibition) Act prohibits Benami transactions and gives the government the right to recover Benami property.According to the act, a Benami transaction is a transaction \"where a property is transferred to or is held by, a person, and the consideration for such property has been provided, or paid by, another person\".It also includes transactions where \"the property is held for the immediate or future benefit, direct or indirect, of the person who has provided the consideration.\"According to the law, the Centre can confiscate any property that has been tagged as a Benami property.Cash and sensitive information can also be termed as 'property' under the act.The amendment that came into effect on November 1, 2016, inserted a sub-section 2 in section 3 of part 3 of the act. It specified that whoever enters a Benami transaction shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of up to three years or a fine or both.The new punishment was also being applied retrospectively to the transactions that took place before 2016.SC, on Tuesday, stated that the provisions under section 3 are 'unduly harsh' and declared them unconstitutional.The provisions under section 5, which allows the government to confiscate the property, were also declared unconstitutional and they were 'half-baked'.In view of the latest judgment, you can fight the case and get him released without any punitive action against him.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Hindu couple residing/working in a foreign land ought to be governed by the matrimonial laws in force at that place. As a corollary, the decree of divorce granted by the foreign court should be valid.Indian courts were confronted with situations wherein Hindu couples married in India as per Hindu Law, settled in a foreign land, develop matrimonial disputes and approach a foreign court. This situation demanded the Indian courts to determine whether the decrees passed by the foreign court as a consequence of the matrimonial disputes between the Hindu couples settled abroad, had any efficacy in India.The non-applicant always has an option not to attend nor actively participate in the foreign court proceedings. This would be taken as, the non-applicant did not submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. This, however, does not mean that the non-applicant is not even required to be served in the foreign court proceedings. Non-service would amount to denial of opportunity to be heard.The non-applicant must be served with notice of the foreign court proceedings. Or else, the proceedings would be taken in law to be a nullity i.e. of no value in law. If this is a situation, Indian courts are likely to declare the entire foreign court proceedings as void.Adultery, as a rule, is proved by, based upon any one or more proofs as below –Circumstantial evidenceEvidence of non-access and birth of childrenContracting of venereal diseasesEvidence of visits to houses of ill reputeDecrees and admissions of parties which should generally be corroboratedThank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "Hello,As for common grounds of divorce, you have cruelty, adultery, desertion/abandonment (two years in India; three in Texas) and unsoundness of mind. This is based on a comparison of section 13 of theHindu Marriage Actand chapter 6, subtitle C, title 1 of the Texas Family Code. As for my advice to you, please read on.First things first, you should strongly consider initiating divorce proceedings in India as opposed to Texas. This is based on the fact that you were married in India which continues to be your country of domicile and the jurisdiction with the closest contact with the dispute. TheHindu Marriage Actobviously governs you. More importantly, it is the jurisdiction that is likely to give you the most amount of grief if your wife sets her mind to it.You see, enforcing a Texan decree – even in case of a contested, “fault” divorce – could be very time consuming and difficult in India for you. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to resist any attempt by your wife to bring fresh divorce proceedings in Texas before or after an Indian decree in your favour (and she may never do that to begin with for myriad reasons). This opinion is based on a survey of Indian and Texan cases includingAshfaq v. Ashfaq, 467 S.W.3d 539 (Tex. App. 2015).Any attempt to initiate fresh proceedings in Texas after an Indian court has ordered the marriage dissolved should come unstuck. The wife will have to show either of two things: (1) Indian court did not have jurisdiction or (2) the divorce proceedings in India were attended by lack of due process. This is a very tall ask that your wife should have a very hard time with. The matter will in all likelihood be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. You will have to get an expert to depose in the Texan court as to the relevant contents of Indian law (as per Tex.R. Evid. 203).This is how the whole thing will play out:You will file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Acton the ground of mental cruelty among other things. If you have proof of actual adultery then that could be a ground in and of itself.You may or may not be able to convince your wife to part amicably during the pendency of said proceeding. If she comes around to your position, the matter will end there amicably.Otherwise you will eventually get your divorce (presuming you have enough evidence to sustain your petition).After the matter concludes in your favour she may not pursue the matter further – or at least not in Texas (on account of legal expenses, familiarity, etc.)If she initiates something in Texas you can have it thrown out on the ground of want of jurisdiction as described above.I will need to know more to give you more specific advice, including info relating to your current living arrangement and properties in Texas. Hope that answers your question. Follow-up questions welcome.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Common grounds for divorce in USA and India",
    "answer": "1. Since it will be a contested  divorce and not amutual consent divorce, the decree of divorce to be passed by the USA Court will not be valid in India. You shall have to file a divorce suit in India also on the ground of cruelty submitting evidence in support of your allegation.2 to 4.  Even in case ofMutual Consent Divorcewhich has common ground to obtain the decree, you shall have to get the decree of divorce passed buy the Foreign Court validated by the concerned District Judge in India, So, no foreign decree will be considered as valid in India unless validated by the District Judge of your area in India for which you shall have to file an application before the said Judge.5. She will not have any power to force you to return to India. However, she can file a 498a case and for attending the criminal case your court presence will be required till it is waived by the Court against your application for the said waiver.6.  The time can not be foretold since  it might depend on how your wife's lawyer will play his part of the game. Ordinarily it might take around 2/3 years.7. When Criminal Case like FIR u/s498a will be pending, it might impact your immigration. You should lodge police complaint in USa and also India (through email) alleging her cruel act on you detailing the acts with evidence to keep the same on record which will be helpful for you in the long run for getting the FIR quashed by you from the appropriate High Court in India.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "The marital laws in Texas and India are very different. The decree of divorce from US is  courts not at all accepted in India. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Foreign court decrees of divorce or dissolution of marriage are valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.The Indian Legal System categorizes Foreign Judgments and Awards from all the quarters of the world into two groups Viz. (a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and (b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and the legal system should avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.is a Non-reciprocating territory.  For enforcing a foreign Judgment or an Award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India, a fresh suit in an Indian Court with appropriate Jurisdiction needs to be instituted. No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of the Indian Judiciary, but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries. Whereas in case the decree is of a court in a non-reciprocating foreign territory, a party has to file a fresh civil action (suit) on that foreign decree, or on the original underlying cause of action, or both in a domestic Indian court of competent jurisdiction. Also the burden to show that the foreign decree, if he sues it, satisfies the tests of Section 13 on the person seeking execution. But once the person seeking execution satisfies the court that the parameters of Section 13 of the CPC are met, it is not possible to examine the sufficiency of evidence on merits before the foreign court, or to test the correctness of the decision.Audio recordings, what’s app screen shots, confessions written in note book are used as evidenceAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "My account freezed with telagana state police and not unfreezing despite contacting multiple times",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’).The purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being ‘disposed of’ or ‘destroyed’. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the ‘Processes to Compel the Production of Things’.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Forceful occupation of property in violation of lease deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 17 of the Registration Act, an arrangement between a tenant and a landlord that involves occupancy of the latter’s premises for a one-year period must be registered in the Sub-Registrar’s Office. Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use. You can also seek police help to throw out the tenant.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To get a final dissolution, the grounds should be cruelty, desertion, adultery or divorce based on one year separate and apart.The benefits of limited dissolution are that the couple can make use of the health insurance of the other or get spousal support benefits until the final divorce in the US.Yes, Indian courts allow conference call attendence for NRI's on a special consideration.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce petition can be filed on any of the legal grounds in India. Once you have decided to move in the direction of divorce it is important that you are prepared for the path ahead. Basic knowledge of legal procedures is very important. You need to do your homework before filing for divorce. The pre- divorce preparations include:1. Going for marital counseling: There are various clinics and associations that offer marital counseling to help the couples decide whether the divorce is actually inevitable. Breaking the family is regarded as the last resort in Indian society. Thus you must try to understand whether the reason for your divorce is actually valid or can be avoided.2. Looking for a competent lawyer: Only a good lawyer can help you with the contemporary divorce laws. A lawyer is essential for taking you forward at the right track while you are fighting for divorce. It would be better if the lawyer is especially experienced in handling divorce cases. Also your comfort level with the lawyer should be good as you need to share your personal details with him.3. Planning your future: Now when you are going to get divorced, you need to plan about various issues like financial backup, shelter, child custody, and so on. All these will take time to settle down, so it’s better to plan everything in advance.The petition will be accepted after you show the evidence that you have been staying separately for 1 year. If there is no contact between you and your spouse for 7 years then the court will issue a divorce decree.After the parties file a joint petition, the court gives a time of 6 months to reconsider the option of divorce.If the parties do not withdraw the petition for divorce within the said period, the court grants the decree of divorce.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My account freezed with telagana state police and not unfreezing despite contacting multiple times",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’).The purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being ‘disposed of’ or ‘destroyed’. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the ‘Processes to Compel the Production of Things’.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to find my property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Land administration essentially involves recording, processing and dissemination of information about the ownership, value, and use of land. The system of land records management varies across states, depending on factors such as historical evolution and local traditions. Broadly, such information can be classified as details of the property (such as tax documents, rental documents), spatial records (such as maps, boundary limits), and transaction records (registered sale deeds). Today, land ownership can be determined through a set of documents. These include: (i) the record of rights (RoR), which captures details such as the name of the land holder, the number and size of the plot area, and revenue rate (for agricultural land), (ii) the registered sale deed to prove that the property has been sold from one person to the other, and the taxes on the sale have been paid, (iii) survey documents to record a property’s boundaries and area, and prove that the property is listed in government records, and (iv) property tax receipts.In December 2016, certain changes were made to DILRMP.As per the changes, survey or re-survey operations will be conducted only when the RoR, or field book or map are not available or are destroyed/ damaged/ outdated. Further, if there is a difference between the area recorded in both the documents, the area recorded in the RoR will prevail. The survey/ re-survey has to be done for each plot of land. Further, the government and each land owner must arrive at an agreement certifying that the owner is satisfied with the survey. This further necessitates the need to undertake surveys on a periodic basis to update information in cadastral maps. The Expert Committee on Land Titling (2014) had recommended that for a guaranteed titling system, it is essential that the spatial and textual records are integrated and unified, so that there is no gap between the two.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use.

    "answer": "Dear Client,When a couple married in India are seeking a divorce in the US, it will not be a simple process as the US lawyer needs to understand the basis of the Indian family system, which in itself is unique. Also, the US lawyer needs to know the various marriage laws in India as it is community-based. TheHindu Marriage Act, Muslim Marriage Act, Dowry Act, etc., are a few Acts that need a clear understanding before handling a case.Being a resident of the state is important.Indian couples can, no doubt, obtain a divorce in the US, but they need to fulfill the residency requirements.If one spouse lives in the US and the other in India, it is still possible to file for divorce in the US but according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian lawIndian couples married in India can initially get a limited dissolution and then the final dissolution in the US. To get a final dissolution, the grounds should be cruelty, desertion, adultery or divorce based on one year separate and apart.The benefits of limited dissolution are that the couple can make use of the health insurance of the other or get spousal support benefits until the final divorce in the US.Yes, Indian courts allow conference call attendence for NRI's on a special consideration.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce petition can be filed on any of the legal grounds in India. Once you have decided to move in the direction of divorce it is important that you are prepared for the path ahead. Basic knowledge of legal procedures is very important. You need to do your homework before filing for divorce. The pre- divorce preparations include:1. Going for marital counseling: There are various clinics and associations that offer marital counseling to help the couples decide whether the divorce is actually inevitable. Breaking the family is regarded as the last resort in Indian society. Thus you must try to understand whether the reason for your divorce is actually valid or can be avoided.2. Looking for a competent lawyer: Only a good lawyer can help you with the contemporary divorce laws. A lawyer is essential for taking you forward at the right track while you are fighting for divorce. It would be better if the lawyer is especially experienced in handling divorce cases. Also your comfort level with the lawyer should be good as you need to share your personal details with him.3. Planning your future: Now when you are going to get divorced, you need to plan about various issues like financial backup, shelter, child custody, and so on. All these will take time to settle down, so it’s better to plan everything in advance.The petition will be accepted after you show the evidence that you have been staying separately for 1 year. If there is no contact between you and your spouse for 7 years then the court will issue a divorce decree.After the parties file a joint petition, the court gives a time of 6 months to reconsider the option of divorce.If the parties do not withdraw the petition for divorce within the said period, the court grants the decree of divorce.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My account freezed with telagana state police and not unfreezing despite contacting multiple times",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To understand the scope of powers that the investigating authorities possess to freeze a bank account, one needs to dive into the source of the power itself. This source can be traced to Section 102 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’).The purpose of Section 102 of the CrPC is to secure the property which has been or suspected to be stolen or which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime from being ‘disposed of’ or ‘destroyed’. Such a measure of seizing property including freezing of bank accounts ensures that the court is able to get back the property concerned. Section 102 of the CrPC falls under Chapter VII which deals with the ‘Processes to Compel the Production of Things’.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1)shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to find my property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Land administration essentially involves recording, processing and dissemination of information about the ownership, value, and use of land. The system of land records management varies across states, depending on factors such as historical evolution and local traditions. Broadly, such information can be classified as details of the property (such as tax documents, rental documents), spatial records (such as maps, boundary limits), and transaction records (registered sale deeds). Today, land ownership can be determined through a set of documents. These include: (i) the record of rights (RoR), which captures details such as the name of the land holder, the number and size of the plot area, and revenue rate (for agricultural land), (ii) the registered sale deed to prove that the property has been sold from one person to the other, and the taxes on the sale have been paid, (iii) survey documents to record a property’s boundaries and area, and prove that the property is listed in government records, and (iv) property tax receipts.In December 2016, certain changes were made to DILRMP.As per the changes, survey or re-survey operations will be conducted only when the RoR, or field book or map are not available or are destroyed/ damaged/ outdated. Further, if there is a difference between the area recorded in both the documents, the area recorded in the RoR will prevail. The survey/ re-survey has to be done for each plot of land. Further, the government and each land owner must arrive at an agreement certifying that the owner is satisfied with the survey. This further necessitates the need to undertake surveys on a periodic basis to update information in cadastral maps. The Expert Committee on Land Titling (2014) had recommended that for a guaranteed titling system, it is essential that the spatial and textual records are integrated and unified, so that there is no gap between the two.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Don’t be panic. As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Ex party divorce decree and custody of child from US courts are not valid in India. Object the jurisdiction of US Court. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.It was ultimately decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India that once the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court, a decree passed by that court, even if ex-parte, is a valid foreign decree.. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court. In general, it can be said that if the partner contesting the divorce actively attends the divorce proceedings in the foreign court, the chances of his or her being able to later successfully approach Indian courts against an unfavorable judgment of the foreign court are very low. Indian courts, or for that matters courts anywhere in the world, do not wish to encourage court-shopping. The well-accepted universal principle of law can be stated as – If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.There is no need to file a custody application if you have physical custody of the child now. You must file a petition for maintenance, protection and alternate accommodation under DV in India.If you send an email to the court, you should object to the court's jurisdiction because marriage was solemnised in India and divorce should be on grounds recognised by theHindu Marriage Act.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

The guilty partner, through an official order, can be asked to live together with the aggrieved partner.Restitution of Conjugal Rightsis a process through which either party can gain certain specific legal rights against the other party. The main right is the right to live with the guilty party. As a remedy, the husband or the wife can file a petition and involve the court for restraining the conjugal rights between the spouses.A decree forRestitution of conjugal Rightscan be passed only in the case of a valid marriage.The Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has a bona fide desire to bring his/her partner back to him/her. If the Court finds out that the Petitioner’s conduct debars him/her from seeking relief of resuming life with his/her spouse, or if any fact or action shows that the Petitioner is taking advantage of his/her wrong, the Court will dismiss the Petition.Similarly, if the Court is satisfied that the Petitioner has good ground and the facts and circumstances stated in the petition are true and in favor of the Petitioner, the other party (Second party) will have to prove that the spouse withdrew from the Petitioner’s life for a reasonable excuse.A parent does not have to share custody of their children, and it can either be shared or not. In the event that the parents cannot agree on a joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if they cannot agree.Guardianship of a minor child is the most common type of custody that India recognises. This type of custody is when one parent holds the title to their child’s care, maintenance, and education. The other parent has visitation rights, but they are not in charge of day-to-day care and education.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 17 of the Registration Act, an arrangement between a tenant and a landlord that involves occupancy of the latter’s premises for a one-year period must be registered in the Sub-Registrar’s Office. Registering a rent agreement is optional in case it’s made for a period of less than 12 months.If you are an owner, you can prevent your tenant from prolonging his stay in your property by including a clause in the rent agreement on increasing the rent to four or five times the existing rent, if he does not leave when the contract ends. This would put a check on such tenants who play foul. However, if the tenant does not vacate the property even after the notice, you can move court. The court can favour a landlord if it finds out that the tenant was involved in any wrongdoing or the owner needed the property for his personal use.

    "question": "How to find my property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Land administration essentially involves recording, processing and dissemination of information about the ownership, value, and use of land. The system of land records management varies across states, depending on factors such as historical evolution and local traditions. Broadly, such information can be classified as details of the property (such as tax documents, rental documents), spatial records (such as maps, boundary limits), and transaction records (registered sale deeds). Today, land ownership can be determined through a set of documents. These include: (i) the record of rights (RoR), which captures details such as the name of the land holder, the number and size of the plot area, and revenue rate (for agricultural land), (ii) the registered sale deed to prove that the property has been sold from one person to the other, and the taxes on the sale have been paid, (iii) survey documents to record a property’s boundaries and area, and prove that the property is listed in government records, and (iv) property tax receipts.In December 2016, certain changes were made to DILRMP.As per the changes, survey or re-survey operations will be conducted only when the RoR, or field book or map are not available or are destroyed/ damaged/ outdated. Further, if there is a difference between the area recorded in both the documents, the area recorded in the RoR will prevail. The survey/ re-survey has to be done for each plot of land. Further, the government and each land owner must arrive at an agreement certifying that the owner is satisfied with the survey. This further necessitates the need to undertake surveys on a periodic basis to update information in cadastral maps. The Expert Committee on Land Titling (2014) had recommended that for a guaranteed titling system, it is essential that the spatial and textual records are integrated and unified, so that there is no gap between the two.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Benami Property Act 1988 and 2016",
    "answer": "The Supreme Court of India (SC) on Tuesday ruled that an amendment to the Benami Act that came into effect on November 1, 2016, cannot be applied retrospectively to the transactions between September 5, 1988, and October 25, 2016.The apex court also declared section 3 of the amendment act unconstitutional. The section provided a three-year jail term and a penalty for people involved in such transactions.\"There is no doubt that the unamended 1988 Act tried to create a strict liability offence and allowed separate acquisition of benami property. This begs the question whether such a criminal provision, which the State now intends to make use of, in order to confiscate properties after 28 years of dormancy, could have existed in the books of law. Other than the abuse and unfairness such exercise intends to bring about, there is a larger constitutional question about existence of such strict provisions without adequate safeguards,\" said the SC bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana.(Prohibition) Act prohibits Benami transactions and gives the government the right to recover Benami property.According to the act, a Benami transaction is a transaction \"where a property is transferred to or is held by, a person, and the consideration for such property has been provided, or paid by, another person\".It also includes transactions where \"the property is held for the immediate or future benefit, direct or indirect, of the person who has provided the consideration.\"According to the law, the Centre can confiscate any property that has been tagged as a Benami property.Cash and sensitive information can also be termed as 'property' under the act.The amendment that came into effect on November 1, 2016, inserted a sub-section 2 in section 3 of part 3 of the act. It specified that whoever enters a Benami transaction shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of up to three years or a fine or both.The new punishment was also being applied retrospectively to the transactions that took place before 2016.SC, on Tuesday, stated that the provisions under section 3 are 'unduly harsh' and declared them unconstitutional.The provisions under section 5, which allows the government to confiscate the property, were also declared unconstitutional and they were 'half-baked'.In view of the latest judgment, you can fight the case and get him released without any punitive action against him.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Once the petition is accepted, then only the divorce process will start, and both parties will need to appear before the court with their attorneys.

    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.ou may approach concerned judicial magistrate with an application seeking to de-freeze the bank account for the reasons you may rely uponT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Unfreezing bank account against accused fraudulent transaction",
    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.ou may approach concerned judicial magistrate with an application seeking to de-freeze the bank account for the reasons you may rely uponT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Courts have allowed for de-freezing of bank accounts on the direction that the party execute a bond for the concerned amount before the Magistrate and produce such amount if so directed by the Magistrate. Section 457 of the CrPC empowers the Magistrate to deliver the seized property to the entitled person.If the police summon you in writing then you have to present yourself at the police station.Police calling the accused and accuse appearing before police for investigation is one of the conditions of the anticipatory bail that the accused shall make himself available for investigation as and when required by the investigating officer.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”.

Facts stated by do not fall in any of the above exceptions. Further, it is difficult to establish such oral agreement without any documentary proof.
