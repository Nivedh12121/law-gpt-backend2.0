    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

There is no legal bar for a person to be both an executor and a legatee (a person who inherits under a will) under the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However, it is advisable to appoint an impartial person as an executor who can carry out the wishes of the testator without any conflict of interest or bias.An executor can charge a fee for his services, but only if the will expressly authorizes him to do so. Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The executor has to declare the fee as part of his income and pay tax on it according to his applicable slab rate. The fee is not exempt from tax under any provision of the Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Hence, there is no restriction in one person being named as the executor as well as the beneficiary of a Will.If for any reason, the named executor cannot act as the executor, or does not show an intent to do so, the bequest being made to such person in the capacity of a beneficiary shall not be valid. If you do not wish to include any other relative or friend as an executor of the Will, you may also consider appointing a professional or a lawyer as the executor.

    "question": "Whatsapp and Email",
    "answer": "You can pass on your instructions for your divorce case through Whatsapp messages or email, as long as you and your lawyer agree on the terms and conditions of such communication. Whatsapp messages and email are considered as valid evidence in Indian courts, as they fall under the category of electronic records under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, you should also be aware of the risks and challenges of using such modes of communication, such as:The authenticity and integrity of the messages or email may be questioned or challenged by the other party or the court, as they can be easily manipulated, deleted, hacked or forged.The confidentiality and privacy of the messages or email may be compromised or violated by third parties, such as service providers, hackers, spyware, etc.The admissibility and reliability of the messages or email may depend on various factors, such as the source, destination, date, time, signature, encryption, etc., of the communication. You may also need to produce additional evidence or witnesses to corroborate or support your messages or email.Therefore, you should follow some best practices and precautions while communicating with your lawyer through Whatsapp messages or email, such as:You should have a written agreement or contract with your lawyer that specifies the scope, purpose, frequency and mode of communication between you and your lawyer. The agreement should also mention the fees, expenses, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in relation to the communication.You should use a secure and reliable platform or service for sending and receiving messages or email. You should also use strong passwords, encryption, antivirus software and other security measures to protect your devices and accounts from unauthorized access or interference.You should keep a backup or copy of all your messages or email in a safe place. You should also maintain a record of the date, time, sender, receiver and subject of each message or email. You should also avoid deleting or altering any message or email that may be relevant for your case.You should use clear and concise language and avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding in your messages or email. You should also avoid using any abusive, offensive or defamatory language that may harm your reputation or case. You should also respect the professional ethics and etiquette of your lawyer and avoid any unnecessary or excessive communication.The best mode of communication for your situation may depend on your personal preference and convenience. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Whatsapp messages or email are:Whatsapp messages are faster and easier to send and receive than email. They are also more interactive and informal than email. However, Whatsapp messages may not have a legal validity or recognition in some countries or jurisdictions. They may also have a lower quality or resolution than email. They may also be subject to data charges or network issues.Email is more formal and professional than Whatsapp messages. They are also more widely accepted and recognized as legal evidence in most countries or jurisdictions. They can also have a higher quality or resolution than Whatsapp messages. They can also attach documents, images, videos or other files that may be relevant for your case. However, email may be slower and harder to send and receive than Whatsapp messages. They may also be less interactive and more impersonal than Whatsapp messages. They may also be subject to spam filters or storage limits.You can avoid conflicts with your lawyer by communicating with him/her in a respectful, honest and cooperative manner. You should also follow his/her advice and instructions regarding your case. You should also pay his/her fees and expenses on time and in full. You should also inform him/her about any changes or developments in your situation that may affect your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,Termination Letter Validity:The validity of a termination letter without a name and designation of an authorized officer may vary by jurisdiction and employment contract. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply in your case.Appropriate Court:The appropriate court to challenge your termination would depend on the nature of your case and local labor laws. Typically, employment-related disputes are taken to the Labor Court or Industrial Tribunal. Consult with a labor lawyer to determine the best course of action.Cheating and Criminal Conspiracy:To pursue a case of cheating (Section 420) and criminal conspiracy, you would need to gather evidence that demonstrates fraudulent intent on the part of the bank. Consult with a criminal lawyer to assess the feasibility of such charges based on the facts of your case.Suit for Damages:You can consider filing a civil suit for damages if you believe you suffered financial harm due to the bank's actions. Consult with a civil lawyer to explore this option.Loan Payment:If you're unable to pay the loan due to circumstances beyond your control, you should communicate with the bank about your situation. They may be willing to offer temporary relief, such as a payment moratorium or restructuring of the loan. Consult with a financial advisor or legal professional to explore your options."

    "question": "Typing error in rectification deed",
    "answer": "A rectification deed is a legal instrument that allows you to correct any minor errors or mistakes in your property documents, such as spelling errors, typing errors, mistakes in property description, etc. A rectification deed is also known as a correction deed, confirmation deed, supplementary deed, amendment deed, etc. A rectification deed is recognized under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and has to be registered to become legally valid.In your case, you have found some typing errors in the rectification deed that was done to correct the measurement of the property in the gift deed. The errors are related to the date and the unit of measurement. These errors can be rectified by executing another rectification deed with the consent of all the parties involved in the original deed. The second rectification deed should clearly mention the errors and the corrections made in the first rectification deed and refer to the registration number and date of the first rectification deed. The second rectification deed should also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable.Alternatively, you can also cancel the first rectification deed and execute a fresh rectification deed with the correct details. However, this may involve more time and cost, as you may have to pay the stamp duty and registration fees again for cancelling and registering the new rectification deed.A deed of declaration is another option that you can consider. A deed of declaration is a document that declares or clarifies certain facts or circumstances related to a property or a transaction. A deed of declaration can be used to explain or supplement the information given in another document, such as a sale deed or a gift deed. A deed of declaration can also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable .The procedure to correct the typing error in your rectification deed may depend on your preference and convenience.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the person who caused the damage to your brother’s car is liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of the accident. Section 140 of the Act deals with the principle of ‘no-fault liability’, which means that the owners of motor vehicles are liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of accidents caused by them, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. Section 163A of the Act provides for a structured formula for calculating the compensation amount based on various factors, such as age, income, disability, etc.Therefore, your brother has the right to claim compensation from the person who was driving the Innova that hit his car from behind. He can file a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Goa, where the accident took place or where he resides. He can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Goa, if he is eligible for it. He will have to submit relevant documents and evidence to prove his claim, such as FIR, medical reports, photographs, witnesses, etc. The MACT will then decide the amount of compensation after hearing both parties and examining the evidence.If your brother was badly injured in the accident, he can also claim compensation for his personal injury and medical expenses. He can also file a criminal case against the person who was driving the Innova for rash and negligent driving under Section 279 and 337 of theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These sections provide for imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs. 1000 or both. However, filing a criminal case may take longer and involve more procedures than filing a civil claim.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In many jurisdictions, if someone is responsible for a car accident due to their negligence or recklessness, they may be liable for the damages they cause. This typically includes damage to the vehicles involved, medical expenses for injuries, and other related costs. However, the specific rules and regulations can vary by location.In your brother's case, it's important to consider the following steps:Contact Insurance: Even if your brother's car is insured, he should report the accident to his insurance company. They can assess the damage and work on the claim, even if the other driver is at fault.Police Report: Since the police were involved and a report was filed, this can be crucial in establishing the facts of the accident.Consult Legal Advice: If the other driver is not cooperating and your brother believes he is not getting the compensation he deserves, he may want to consult with a personal injury attorney or a lawyer specializing in car accidents. They can advise him on the best course of action based on local laws.Medical Evaluation: If your brother or anyone else involved in the accident sustained injuries, it's essential to seek medical attention. Injuries may not be immediately apparent, so a medical evaluation is important for documenting any health issues related to the accident."

Misrepresentation is defined as any statement or assertion that is untrue or misleading, but not made with an intention to deceive.Some of the elements of fraud and misrepresentation are:There must be a false or misleading statement or omission of a material fact by one party to another party.The statement or omission must relate to an essential or important aspect of the contract, such as the title, possession, quality, or value of the property.The statement or omission must induce or influence the other party to enter into the contract or act upon it.The other party must suffer some loss or injury as a result of relying on the statement or omission.In your case, you may be able to prove these elements by showing that:The developer did not inform you or disclose to you about the two pending litigation related to the project at the time of agreement and registration.The litigation was a material fact that affected the legal status and value of the property and your rights and interests as a buyer.You entered into the contract and paid 85% of the total payment based on the developer’s representation that the property was free from any legal disputes or encumbrances.You suffered loss and injury as you could not take possession of the property, faced legal action from the plaintiff, and had to stop further payment due to the litigation.Therefore, you may have a valid ground to cancel the contract and claim damages from the developer for fraud and misrepresentation.Some of the legal options available for you are:You can file a civil suit against the developer in the competent court in India for cancellation of contract, specific performance, injunction, declaration, or compensation. You can also seek interim relief from the court to restrain the developer from selling or transferring the property to any other person or creating any third party rights over it.You can file a criminal complaint against the developer in the police station or the magistrate’s court in India for cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, or criminal conspiracy under theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These offences are punishable with imprisonment and fine.You can file a consumer complaint against the developer in the consumer forum or commission in India for deficiency in service, unfair trade practice, or violation of consumer rights under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. You can claim refund, compensation, interest, or penalty from the developer.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for taking legal action against the developer for putting you in such a situation. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with the developer amicably through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine.

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval.

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Firstly the Will shall come into force only after the death of the testator.Secondly, once the Will comes into force and unfortunately if the beneficiary is not able to transfer the properties to his/her name during the lifetime, then it shall automatically devolve on the legal heirs of the beneficiary.The testator has full rights to cancel the Will or change it or make a codicil of the Will during his/her lifetime.Therefore in the event of the death of the beneficiary before the Will comes into force and the testator wants to cancel the Will consequent upon the death of the beneficiary, then the legal heirs of the cannot claim the benefits for any reason neither they will have any rights to challenge the cancellation of the Will by the testator upon the death of the beneficiary.If the testator would like this property bequeathed in the Will should go to the beneficiary alone or in the event of his/her death during the lifetime of the testator, then the testator can make a recital stating the consequent upon the death of the beneficiary before the enforcement of the Will the property bequeathed shall go to the second named beneficiary for whatever reason the testator may rely upon.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Does daughter have any right in father's business run by brother after father's death",
    "answer": "You have the right to claim your share in your father’s business, as well as the profits he earned after his death. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, as amended in 2005, daughters have equal rights as sons in their father’s property, whether it is ancestral or self-acquired. Since your father died without a will, his property will be divided equally among his legal heirs, which include you, your brother, and your mother (if she is alive). Therefore, you can file a suit for partition and accounting of the business, and demand your share of the assets and profits. You can also ask for the books of accounts and other documents related to the business, to verify the income and expenditure of the business.However, you will have to file the suit in Imphal, where the business is located and where your brother resides. The jurisdiction of a civil suit is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business. Since both these factors are in Imphal, you cannot file the suit in Delhi. You will have to engage a lawyer in Imphal who can represent you in the court there. You can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Imphal, if you are eligible for it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Does daughter have any right in father's business run by brother after father's death",
    "answer": "Dear client,Inheritance Rights: In the absence of a will, the inheritance laws of the state where your father resided and owned the business would typically apply. These laws determine how your father's assets, including the shoe shop, are distributed among his legal heirs. You and your siblings may have a legitimate claim to a share of the business as his legal heirs.Types of Legal Actions:You can file a suit for partition to claim your rightful share of the business's assets.You may also request an account of the business's financial transactions and profits to assess the value of your share.Location for Filing Suit: The location for filing the suit would generally be in the jurisdiction where the business is located, which, in this case, is Imphal, Manipur. It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Imphal who specializes in property and inheritance law. They can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements for your case.Legal Counsel: It's crucial to seek legal counsel to navigate this situation effectively. A lawyer can help you understand your rights, draft necessary legal documents, and represent your interests in court if required."

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

In many cases, a simple written notice may suffice, but it's often better to follow the specific guidelines outlined in your contract or engagement agreement with the lawyer. Sometimes, contracts stipulate the method or form of cancellation, which might include sending a formal letter or notice. Others might accept an email or a written statement. However, it's crucial to ensure that whatever method you choose meets the legal requirements and the terms of the agreement. If you're unsure about the appropriate method or if your agreement doesn't specify, it's a good idea to reach out to the lawyer or their firm directly to confirm the correct procedure for canceling services.

    "question": "Marrying an American",
    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Whatsapp and Email",
    "answer": "You can pass on your instructions for your divorce case through Whatsapp messages or email, as long as you and your lawyer agree on the terms and conditions of such communication. Whatsapp messages and email are considered as valid evidence in Indian courts, as they fall under the category of electronic records under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, you should also be aware of the risks and challenges of using such modes of communication, such as:The authenticity and integrity of the messages or email may be questioned or challenged by the other party or the court, as they can be easily manipulated, deleted, hacked or forged.The confidentiality and privacy of the messages or email may be compromised or violated by third parties, such as service providers, hackers, spyware, etc.The admissibility and reliability of the messages or email may depend on various factors, such as the source, destination, date, time, signature, encryption, etc., of the communication. You may also need to produce additional evidence or witnesses to corroborate or support your messages or email.Therefore, you should follow some best practices and precautions while communicating with your lawyer through Whatsapp messages or email, such as:You should have a written agreement or contract with your lawyer that specifies the scope, purpose, frequency and mode of communication between you and your lawyer. The agreement should also mention the fees, expenses, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in relation to the communication.You should use a secure and reliable platform or service for sending and receiving messages or email. You should also use strong passwords, encryption, antivirus software and other security measures to protect your devices and accounts from unauthorized access or interference.You should keep a backup or copy of all your messages or email in a safe place. You should also maintain a record of the date, time, sender, receiver and subject of each message or email. You should also avoid deleting or altering any message or email that may be relevant for your case.You should use clear and concise language and avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding in your messages or email. You should also avoid using any abusive, offensive or defamatory language that may harm your reputation or case. You should also respect the professional ethics and etiquette of your lawyer and avoid any unnecessary or excessive communication.The best mode of communication for your situation may depend on your personal preference and convenience. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Whatsapp messages or email are:Whatsapp messages are faster and easier to send and receive than email. They are also more interactive and informal than email. However, Whatsapp messages may not have a legal validity or recognition in some countries or jurisdictions. They may also have a lower quality or resolution than email. They may also be subject to data charges or network issues.Email is more formal and professional than Whatsapp messages. They are also more widely accepted and recognized as legal evidence in most countries or jurisdictions. They can also have a higher quality or resolution than Whatsapp messages. They can also attach documents, images, videos or other files that may be relevant for your case. However, email may be slower and harder to send and receive than Whatsapp messages. They may also be less interactive and more impersonal than Whatsapp messages. They may also be subject to spam filters or storage limits.You can avoid conflicts with your lawyer by communicating with him/her in a respectful, honest and cooperative manner. You should also follow his/her advice and instructions regarding your case. You should also pay his/her fees and expenses on time and in full.

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval. The possibility of getting back wages and employment upon company revival hinges on feasibility, viability, and worker consent. The IBC prevails over the IDA in matters of corporate insolvency.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer. You can also verify these documents from the concerned authorities or offices where they are registered or recorded.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, you would typically need the involvement of the mother (since she is the current owner), Son2 (the original owner), and potentially Son1 if he has been granted power of attorney (GPA) by Son2.Moreover in India general power of attorney is valid. General Power of Attorney (GPA) isa legal document that gives someone the authority to legally act on your behalf in a certain situation. This can be useful if you are unable to make decisions for yourself, or if you need someone to help manage your finances, property, or other important affairsBesides the GPA, you may need other documents like property titles, clearances, and any relevant tax records.Regarding the Will document and Generic GPA, you may have the right to request them, but their disclosure would depend on the willingness of Son2 and Son1 to share these documents.

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

In many cases, a simple written notice may suffice, but it's often better to follow the specific guidelines outlined in your contract or engagement agreement with the lawyer. Sometimes, contracts stipulate the method or form of cancellation, which might include sending a formal letter or notice. Others might accept an email or a written statement. However, it's crucial to ensure that whatever method you choose meets the legal requirements and the terms of the agreement. If you're unsure about the appropriate method or if your agreement doesn't specify, it's a good idea to reach out to the lawyer or their firm directly to confirm the correct procedure for canceling services.

    "question": "Marrying an American",
    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. Insofar as this particular property is concerned, the mother is now the absolute owner with clear and marketable title on her name by the virtue of the registered gift deed through which the property was transferred to her name.2. The alleged generic POA deed is a nominal one without any value or would be considered as legally valid especially if this POA deed is used for transferring the immovable property because there are no particulars or details of the property to be transferred, hence it is void.3. Your vendor should provide you the original gift deed, original sale deed on the name of her donor, the link document in original in respect of the property sold by the vendor to the son2, encumbrance certificate, property tax receipts, mutation records if any, khata and any other relevant documents pertaining to this property.4.

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer. You can also verify these documents from the concerned authorities or offices where they are registered or recorded.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, you would typically need the involvement of the mother (since she is the current owner), Son2 (the original owner), and potentially Son1 if he has been granted power of attorney (GPA) by Son2.Moreover in India general power of attorney is valid. General Power of Attorney (GPA) isa legal document that gives someone the authority to legally act on your behalf in a certain situation. This can be useful if you are unable to make decisions for yourself, or if you need someone to help manage your finances, property, or other important affairsBesides the GPA, you may need other documents like property titles, clearances, and any relevant tax records.Regarding the Will document and Generic GPA, you may have the right to request them, but their disclosure would depend on the willingness of Son2 and Son1 to share these documents.

    "question": "Whatsapp and Email",
    "answer": "You can pass on your instructions for your divorce case through Whatsapp messages or email, as long as you and your lawyer agree on the terms and conditions of such communication. Whatsapp messages and email are considered as valid evidence in Indian courts, as they fall under the category of electronic records under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, you should also be aware of the risks and challenges of using such modes of communication, such as:The authenticity and integrity of the messages or email may be questioned or challenged by the other party or the court, as they can be easily manipulated, deleted, hacked or forged.The confidentiality and privacy of the messages or email may be compromised or violated by third parties, such as service providers, hackers, spyware, etc.The admissibility and reliability of the messages or email may depend on various factors, such as the source, destination, date, time, signature, encryption, etc., of the communication. You may also need to produce additional evidence or witnesses to corroborate or support your messages or email.Therefore, you should follow some best practices and precautions while communicating with your lawyer through Whatsapp messages or email, such as:You should have a written agreement or contract with your lawyer that specifies the scope, purpose, frequency and mode of communication between you and your lawyer. The agreement should also mention the fees, expenses, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in relation to the communication.You should use a secure and reliable platform or service for sending and receiving messages or email. You should also use strong passwords, encryption, antivirus software and other security measures to protect your devices and accounts from unauthorized access or interference.You should keep a backup or copy of all your messages or email in a safe place.

You should also avoid deleting or altering any message or email that may be relevant for your case.You should use clear and concise language and avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding in your messages or email. You should also avoid using any abusive, offensive or defamatory language that may harm your reputation or case. You should also respect the professional ethics and etiquette of your lawyer and avoid any unnecessary or excessive communication.The best mode of communication for your situation may depend on your personal preference and convenience. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Whatsapp messages or email are:Whatsapp messages are faster and easier to send and receive than email. They are also more interactive and informal than email. However, Whatsapp messages may not have a legal validity or recognition in some countries or jurisdictions. They may also have a lower quality or resolution than email. They may also be subject to data charges or network issues.Email is more formal and professional than Whatsapp messages. They are also more widely accepted and recognized as legal evidence in most countries or jurisdictions. They can also have a higher quality or resolution than Whatsapp messages. They can also attach documents, images, videos or other files that may be relevant for your case. However, email may be slower and harder to send and receive than Whatsapp messages. They may also be less interactive and more impersonal than Whatsapp messages. They may also be subject to spam filters or storage limits.You can avoid conflicts with your lawyer by communicating with him/her in a respectful, honest and cooperative manner. You should also follow his/her advice and instructions regarding your case. You should also pay his/her fees and expenses on time and in full.

    "question": "Mental harassment by my wife",
    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offences are also non-bailable and non-compoundable.You can file a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 27(1)(d) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. You have to prove that your wife has treated you with such cruelty that it is not possible for you to live with her. You have to provide evidence of her cruel behaviour, such as audio recordings, video recordings, chat screenshots, witness statements, medical reports, etc. You can also claim alimony, custody, or maintenance from your wife depending on your circumstances.You can file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty under Section 10(1)(b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 23(1)(a) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. Judicial separation is a legal process where the spouses live separately without dissolving their marriage. It may be a temporary or permanent arrangement depending on their mutual consent. Judicial separation may help you to resolve your differences with your wife or prepare for divorce if reconciliation is not possible.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for your future course of action. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with your wife amicably through counselling, mediation, or negotiation. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval. The possibility of getting back wages and employment upon company revival hinges on feasibility, viability, and worker consent.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act.

The condition for the same is Neither party has more than one spouse living. Neither party is an idiot or lunatic. The parties should complete 21 years of age at the time of registration. Both the parties should reside within the jurisdiction of the Marriage Officer for a period of 30 days.under section 5 of theSpecial Marriages Act, a notice in writing has to be given to a Marriage Officer of the district who then publishes it for 30 days in a \"conspicuous place in his office\" to invite objections to it. After the expiry of 30 days from the date that such notice was published, the marriage is then said to be solemnized. But if any person related to the parties objects to this marriage and the registrar finds that it is a reasonable cause of objection, on such grounds he can cancel the marriage.However,  if your parents object to it, you can file a case against them.  And there are number of judgement and judicial precedents to support your vaseAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Whatsapp and Email",
    "answer": "You can pass on your instructions for your divorce case through Whatsapp messages or email, as long as you and your lawyer agree on the terms and conditions of such communication. Whatsapp messages and email are considered as valid evidence in Indian courts, as they fall under the category of electronic records under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, you should also be aware of the risks and challenges of using such modes of communication, such as:The authenticity and integrity of the messages or email may be questioned or challenged by the other party or the court, as they can be easily manipulated, deleted, hacked or forged.The confidentiality and privacy of the messages or email may be compromised or violated by third parties, such as service providers, hackers, spyware, etc.The admissibility and reliability of the messages or email may depend on various factors, such as the source, destination, date, time, signature, encryption, etc., of the communication. You may also need to produce additional evidence or witnesses to corroborate or support your messages or email.Therefore, you should follow some best practices and precautions while communicating with your lawyer through Whatsapp messages or email, such as:You should have a written agreement or contract with your lawyer that specifies the scope, purpose, frequency and mode of communication between you and your lawyer. The agreement should also mention the fees, expenses, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in relation to the communication.You should use a secure and reliable platform or service for sending and receiving messages or email. You should also use strong passwords, encryption, antivirus software and other security measures to protect your devices and accounts from unauthorized access or interference.You should keep a backup or copy of all your messages or email in a safe place.

You should also avoid deleting or altering any message or email that may be relevant for your case.You should use clear and concise language and avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding in your messages or email. You should also avoid using any abusive, offensive or defamatory language that may harm your reputation or case. You should also respect the professional ethics and etiquette of your lawyer and avoid any unnecessary or excessive communication.The best mode of communication for your situation may depend on your personal preference and convenience. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Whatsapp messages or email are:Whatsapp messages are faster and easier to send and receive than email. They are also more interactive and informal than email. However, Whatsapp messages may not have a legal validity or recognition in some countries or jurisdictions. They may also have a lower quality or resolution than email. They may also be subject to data charges or network issues.Email is more formal and professional than Whatsapp messages. They are also more widely accepted and recognized as legal evidence in most countries or jurisdictions. They can also have a higher quality or resolution than Whatsapp messages. They can also attach documents, images, videos or other files that may be relevant for your case. However, email may be slower and harder to send and receive than Whatsapp messages. They may also be less interactive and more impersonal than Whatsapp messages. They may also be subject to spam filters or storage limits.You can avoid conflicts with your lawyer by communicating with him/her in a respectful, honest and cooperative manner. You should also follow his/her advice and instructions regarding your case. You should also pay his/her fees and expenses on time and in full.

    "question": "Mental harassment by my wife",
    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offences are also non-bailable and non-compoundable.You can file a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 27(1)(d) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. You have to prove that your wife has treated you with such cruelty that it is not possible for you to live with her. You have to provide evidence of her cruel behaviour, such as audio recordings, video recordings, chat screenshots, witness statements, medical reports, etc. You can also claim alimony, custody, or maintenance from your wife depending on your circumstances.You can file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty under Section 10(1)(b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 23(1)(a) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. Judicial separation is a legal process where the spouses live separately without dissolving their marriage. It may be a temporary or permanent arrangement depending on their mutual consent. Judicial separation may help you to resolve your differences with your wife or prepare for divorce if reconciliation is not possible.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for your future course of action. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with your wife amicably through counselling, mediation, or negotiation. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval. The possibility of getting back wages and employment upon company revival hinges on feasibility, viability, and worker consent.

The alleged generic POA deed is a nominal one without any value or would be considered as legally valid especially if this POA deed is used for transferring the immovable property because there are no particulars or details of the property to be transferred, hence it is void.3. Your vendor should provide you the original gift deed, original sale deed on the name of her donor, the link document in original in respect of the property sold by the vendor to the son2, encumbrance certificate, property tax receipts, mutation records if any, khata and any other relevant documents pertaining to this property.4.

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer. You can also verify these documents from the concerned authorities or offices where they are registered or recorded.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, you would typically need the involvement of the mother (since she is the current owner), Son2 (the original owner), and potentially Son1 if he has been granted power of attorney (GPA) by Son2.Moreover in India general power of attorney is valid. General Power of Attorney (GPA) isa legal document that gives someone the authority to legally act on your behalf in a certain situation. This can be useful if you are unable to make decisions for yourself, or if you need someone to help manage your finances, property, or other important affairsBesides the GPA, you may need other documents like property titles, clearances, and any relevant tax records.Regarding the Will document and Generic GPA, you may have the right to request them, but their disclosure would depend on the willingness of Son2 and Son1 to share these documents. In some cases, these documents may be private, and their sharing may require the consent of the individuals involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

In many cases, a simple written notice may suffice, but it's often better to follow the specific guidelines outlined in your contract or engagement agreement with the lawyer. Sometimes, contracts stipulate the method or form of cancellation, which might include sending a formal letter or notice. Others might accept an email or a written statement. However, it's crucial to ensure that whatever method you choose meets the legal requirements and the terms of the agreement. If you're unsure about the appropriate method or if your agreement doesn't specify, it's a good idea to reach out to the lawyer or their firm directly to confirm the correct procedure for canceling services.

There is no legal bar for a person to be both an executor and a legatee (a person who inherits under a will) under the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However, it is advisable to appoint an impartial person as an executor who can carry out the wishes of the testator without any conflict of interest or bias.An executor can charge a fee for his services, but only if the will expressly authorizes him to do so. Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The executor has to declare the fee as part of his income and pay tax on it according to his applicable slab rate. The fee is not exempt from tax under any provision of the Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Hence, there is no restriction in one person being named as the executor as well as the beneficiary of a Will.If for any reason, the named executor cannot act as the executor, or does not show an intent to do so, the bequest being made to such person in the capacity of a beneficiary shall not be valid. If you do not wish to include any other relative or friend as an executor of the Will, you may also consider appointing a professional or a lawyer as the executor.

    "question": "Marrying an American",
    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Mental harassment by my wife",
    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offences are also non-bailable and non-compoundable.You can file a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 27(1)(d) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. You have to prove that your wife has treated you with such cruelty that it is not possible for you to live with her. You have to provide evidence of her cruel behaviour, such as audio recordings, video recordings, chat screenshots, witness statements, medical reports, etc. You can also claim alimony, custody, or maintenance from your wife depending on your circumstances.You can file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty under Section 10(1)(b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 23(1)(a) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. Judicial separation is a legal process where the spouses live separately without dissolving their marriage. It may be a temporary or permanent arrangement depending on their mutual consent. Judicial separation may help you to resolve your differences with your wife or prepare for divorce if reconciliation is not possible.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for your future course of action. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with your wife amicably through counselling, mediation, or negotiation. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

There is no legal bar for a person to be both an executor and a legatee (a person who inherits under a will) under the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However, it is advisable to appoint an impartial person as an executor who can carry out the wishes of the testator without any conflict of interest or bias.An executor can charge a fee for his services, but only if the will expressly authorizes him to do so. Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The executor has to declare the fee as part of his income and pay tax on it according to his applicable slab rate.

If you do not wish to include any other relative or friend as an executor of the Will, you may also consider appointing a professional or a lawyer as the executor.

    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Renting a flat for fiancee",
    "answer": "Renting a property in India as an unmarried couple is legal, but it may depend on the state and local laws, as well as the discretion of the landlord. You should be aware that while renting a property, you must create a rent agreement in the names of both parties and get it duly signed by them to safeguard your rights for the future. The rent agreement should also mention the ratio of the rent amount paid by each party and the mode of payment. You may also need to provide proof of identity and address for both of you, such as passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, etc.If you want to use the rent agreement to update your address on your documents for passport purpose, you should make sure that the agreement is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has a stamp duty paid on it. A registered rent agreement is a valid proof of address for passport application.Your backup plan of renting the property only under your name but having the full rent amount paid by your American fiancée may not be advisable, as it may raise suspicion from the landlord and the authorities. It may also create problems for you in proving your lawful tenancy and claiming your rights in case of any dispute.

    "question": "Typing error in rectification deed",
    "answer": "A rectification deed is a legal instrument that allows you to correct any minor errors or mistakes in your property documents, such as spelling errors, typing errors, mistakes in property description, etc. A rectification deed is also known as a correction deed, confirmation deed, supplementary deed, amendment deed, etc. A rectification deed is recognized under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and has to be registered to become legally valid.In your case, you have found some typing errors in the rectification deed that was done to correct the measurement of the property in the gift deed. The errors are related to the date and the unit of measurement. These errors can be rectified by executing another rectification deed with the consent of all the parties involved in the original deed. The second rectification deed should clearly mention the errors and the corrections made in the first rectification deed and refer to the registration number and date of the first rectification deed. The second rectification deed should also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable.Alternatively, you can also cancel the first rectification deed and execute a fresh rectification deed with the correct details. However, this may involve more time and cost, as you may have to pay the stamp duty and registration fees again for cancelling and registering the new rectification deed.A deed of declaration is another option that you can consider. A deed of declaration is a document that declares or clarifies certain facts or circumstances related to a property or a transaction. A deed of declaration can be used to explain or supplement the information given in another document, such as a sale deed or a gift deed. A deed of declaration can also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable .The procedure to correct the typing error in your rectification deed may depend on your preference and convenience.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the person who caused the damage to your brother’s car is liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of the accident. Section 140 of the Act deals with the principle of ‘no-fault liability’, which means that the owners of motor vehicles are liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of accidents caused by them, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. Section 163A of the Act provides for a structured formula for calculating the compensation amount based on various factors, such as age, income, disability, etc.Therefore, your brother has the right to claim compensation from the person who was driving the Innova that hit his car from behind. He can file a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Goa, where the accident took place or where he resides. He can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Goa, if he is eligible for it. He will have to submit relevant documents and evidence to prove his claim, such as FIR, medical reports, photographs, witnesses, etc. The MACT will then decide the amount of compensation after hearing both parties and examining the evidence.If your brother was badly injured in the accident, he can also claim compensation for his personal injury and medical expenses. He can also file a criminal case against the person who was driving the Innova for rash and negligent driving under Section 279 and 337 of theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These sections provide for imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs. 1000 or both. However, filing a criminal case may take longer and involve more procedures than filing a civil claim.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In many jurisdictions, if someone is responsible for a car accident due to their negligence or recklessness, they may be liable for the damages they cause. This typically includes damage to the vehicles involved, medical expenses for injuries, and other related costs. However, the specific rules and regulations can vary by location.In your brother's case, it's important to consider the following steps:Contact Insurance: Even if your brother's car is insured, he should report the accident to his insurance company. They can assess the damage and work on the claim, even if the other driver is at fault.Police Report: Since the police were involved and a report was filed, this can be crucial in establishing the facts of the accident.Consult Legal Advice: If the other driver is not cooperating and your brother believes he is not getting the compensation he deserves, he may want to consult with a personal injury attorney or a lawyer specializing in car accidents. They can advise him on the best course of action based on local laws.Medical Evaluation: If your brother or anyone else involved in the accident sustained injuries, it's essential to seek medical attention. Injuries may not be immediately apparent, so a medical evaluation is important for documenting any health issues related to the accident."

    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offences are also non-bailable and non-compoundable.You can file a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 27(1)(d) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. You have to prove that your wife has treated you with such cruelty that it is not possible for you to live with her. You have to provide evidence of her cruel behaviour, such as audio recordings, video recordings, chat screenshots, witness statements, medical reports, etc. You can also claim alimony, custody, or maintenance from your wife depending on your circumstances.You can file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty under Section 10(1)(b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 23(1)(a) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. Judicial separation is a legal process where the spouses live separately without dissolving their marriage. It may be a temporary or permanent arrangement depending on their mutual consent. Judicial separation may help you to resolve your differences with your wife or prepare for divorce if reconciliation is not possible.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for your future course of action. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with your wife amicably through counselling, mediation, or negotiation. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Counter-claim being in the nature of cross-suit, is not affected by the dismissal of plaintiff's suit. The counter claim has to be disposed of on merits. Therefore, the dismissal of plaintiff's suit on the ground of withdrawal of the suit by the plaintiff would not affect the counter claim of the defendant.The effect of the counterclaim is that even if the suit of the plaintiff is stayed, discontinued, dismissed or withdrawn,the counterclaim will be decided on merits and the defendant will have a right to get a decree for a counterclaim as claimed in the written statement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Maintainability of counter claim after withdrawal of O.S, of Plaintiff",
    "answer": "- The counter-claim can be treated as a plaint and the plaintiff can file a written statement in answer to it.- However, as per the Supreme Court in the case of Ashok Kumar Kalra versus Wing Cdr. Surendra Agnihotri , that the court shall permit the filing of the counter claim only after the written statement is filed, but not after the issues are formulated.- Further, if the main suit is stayed, dismissed, or discontinued, the counterclaim can still proceed, as stipulated under Order 8 Rule 6 D, however it should be treated independently.- Hence , with the withdrawal of the main suit by the Plaintiff , the counter claim filed by the defendant cannot be initiated as the suit of the defendant under the main suit number.- The limitation for filing the objection or reply is 30 to 90 days from the date of service of the summon on you.- You can approach the higher court against the order of the said court for treating the counter claim as main suit  filed and withdrawn by you .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

There is no legal bar for a person to be both an executor and a legatee (a person who inherits under a will) under the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However, it is advisable to appoint an impartial person as an executor who can carry out the wishes of the testator without any conflict of interest or bias.An executor can charge a fee for his services, but only if the will expressly authorizes him to do so. Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The executor has to declare the fee as part of his income and pay tax on it according to his applicable slab rate.

Hence, there is no restriction in one person being named as the executor as well as the beneficiary of a Will.If for any reason, the named executor cannot act as the executor, or does not show an intent to do so, the bequest being made to such person in the capacity of a beneficiary shall not be valid. If you do not wish to include any other relative or friend as an executor of the Will, you may also consider appointing a professional or a lawyer as the executor.

    "question": "Typing error in rectification deed",
    "answer": "A rectification deed is a legal instrument that allows you to correct any minor errors or mistakes in your property documents, such as spelling errors, typing errors, mistakes in property description, etc. A rectification deed is also known as a correction deed, confirmation deed, supplementary deed, amendment deed, etc. A rectification deed is recognized under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and has to be registered to become legally valid.In your case, you have found some typing errors in the rectification deed that was done to correct the measurement of the property in the gift deed. The errors are related to the date and the unit of measurement. These errors can be rectified by executing another rectification deed with the consent of all the parties involved in the original deed. The second rectification deed should clearly mention the errors and the corrections made in the first rectification deed and refer to the registration number and date of the first rectification deed. The second rectification deed should also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable.Alternatively, you can also cancel the first rectification deed and execute a fresh rectification deed with the correct details. However, this may involve more time and cost, as you may have to pay the stamp duty and registration fees again for cancelling and registering the new rectification deed.A deed of declaration is another option that you can consider. A deed of declaration is a document that declares or clarifies certain facts or circumstances related to a property or a transaction. A deed of declaration can be used to explain or supplement the information given in another document, such as a sale deed or a gift deed. A deed of declaration can also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable .The procedure to correct the typing error in your rectification deed may depend on your preference and convenience.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the person who caused the damage to your brother’s car is liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of the accident. Section 140 of the Act deals with the principle of ‘no-fault liability’, which means that the owners of motor vehicles are liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of accidents caused by them, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. Section 163A of the Act provides for a structured formula for calculating the compensation amount based on various factors, such as age, income, disability, etc.Therefore, your brother has the right to claim compensation from the person who was driving the Innova that hit his car from behind. He can file a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Goa, where the accident took place or where he resides. He can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Goa, if he is eligible for it. He will have to submit relevant documents and evidence to prove his claim, such as FIR, medical reports, photographs, witnesses, etc. The MACT will then decide the amount of compensation after hearing both parties and examining the evidence.If your brother was badly injured in the accident, he can also claim compensation for his personal injury and medical expenses. He can also file a criminal case against the person who was driving the Innova for rash and negligent driving under Section 279 and 337 of theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These sections provide for imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs. 1000 or both. However, filing a criminal case may take longer and involve more procedures than filing a civil claim.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In many jurisdictions, if someone is responsible for a car accident due to their negligence or recklessness, they may be liable for the damages they cause. This typically includes damage to the vehicles involved, medical expenses for injuries, and other related costs. However, the specific rules and regulations can vary by location.In your brother's case, it's important to consider the following steps:Contact Insurance: Even if your brother's car is insured, he should report the accident to his insurance company. They can assess the damage and work on the claim, even if the other driver is at fault.Police Report: Since the police were involved and a report was filed, this can be crucial in establishing the facts of the accident.Consult Legal Advice: If the other driver is not cooperating and your brother believes he is not getting the compensation he deserves, he may want to consult with a personal injury attorney or a lawyer specializing in car accidents. They can advise him on the best course of action based on local laws.Medical Evaluation: If your brother or anyone else involved in the accident sustained injuries, it's essential to seek medical attention. Injuries may not be immediately apparent, so a medical evaluation is important for documenting any health issues related to the accident."

    "question": "Does daughter have any right in father's business run by brother after father's death",
    "answer": "You have the right to claim your share in your father’s business, as well as the profits he earned after his death. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, as amended in 2005, daughters have equal rights as sons in their father’s property, whether it is ancestral or self-acquired. Since your father died without a will, his property will be divided equally among his legal heirs, which include you, your brother, and your mother (if she is alive). Therefore, you can file a suit for partition and accounting of the business, and demand your share of the assets and profits. You can also ask for the books of accounts and other documents related to the business, to verify the income and expenditure of the business.However, you will have to file the suit in Imphal, where the business is located and where your brother resides. The jurisdiction of a civil suit is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business. Since both these factors are in Imphal, you cannot file the suit in Delhi. You will have to engage a lawyer in Imphal who can represent you in the court there. You can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Imphal, if you are eligible for it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit. It's best to have a reasonable amount in your bank account to demonstrate financial sufficiency.Remember that visa requirements can change, and it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by the Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine when applying for your visa."

    "question": "Renting a flat for fiancee",
    "answer": "Renting a property in India as an unmarried couple is legal, but it may depend on the state and local laws, as well as the discretion of the landlord. You should be aware that while renting a property, you must create a rent agreement in the names of both parties and get it duly signed by them to safeguard your rights for the future. The rent agreement should also mention the ratio of the rent amount paid by each party and the mode of payment. You may also need to provide proof of identity and address for both of you, such as passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, etc.If you want to use the rent agreement to update your address on your documents for passport purpose, you should make sure that the agreement is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has a stamp duty paid on it. A registered rent agreement is a valid proof of address for passport application.Your backup plan of renting the property only under your name but having the full rent amount paid by your American fiancée may not be advisable, as it may raise suspicion from the landlord and the authorities. It may also create problems for you in proving your lawful tenancy and claiming your rights in case of any dispute. It is better to have a joint rent agreement with both of your names and signatures on it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

It's advisable to consult with a legal professional to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply in your case.Appropriate Court:The appropriate court to challenge your termination would depend on the nature of your case and local labor laws. Typically, employment-related disputes are taken to the Labor Court or Industrial Tribunal. Consult with a labor lawyer to determine the best course of action.Cheating and Criminal Conspiracy:To pursue a case of cheating (Section 420) and criminal conspiracy, you would need to gather evidence that demonstrates fraudulent intent on the part of the bank. Consult with a criminal lawyer to assess the feasibility of such charges based on the facts of your case.Suit for Damages:You can consider filing a civil suit for damages if you believe you suffered financial harm due to the bank's actions. Consult with a civil lawyer to explore this option.Loan Payment:If you're unable to pay the loan due to circumstances beyond your control, you should communicate with the bank about your situation. They may be willing to offer temporary relief, such as a payment moratorium or restructuring of the loan. Consult with a financial advisor or legal professional to explore your options."

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the person who caused the damage to your brother’s car is liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of the accident. Section 140 of the Act deals with the principle of ‘no-fault liability’, which means that the owners of motor vehicles are liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of accidents caused by them, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. Section 163A of the Act provides for a structured formula for calculating the compensation amount based on various factors, such as age, income, disability, etc.Therefore, your brother has the right to claim compensation from the person who was driving the Innova that hit his car from behind. He can file a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Goa, where the accident took place or where he resides.

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "Dear client,In many jurisdictions, if someone is responsible for a car accident due to their negligence or recklessness, they may be liable for the damages they cause. This typically includes damage to the vehicles involved, medical expenses for injuries, and other related costs. However, the specific rules and regulations can vary by location.In your brother's case, it's important to consider the following steps:Contact Insurance: Even if your brother's car is insured, he should report the accident to his insurance company. They can assess the damage and work on the claim, even if the other driver is at fault.Police Report: Since the police were involved and a report was filed, this can be crucial in establishing the facts of the accident.Consult Legal Advice: If the other driver is not cooperating and your brother believes he is not getting the compensation he deserves, he may want to consult with a personal injury attorney or a lawyer specializing in car accidents. They can advise him on the best course of action based on local laws.Medical Evaluation: If your brother or anyone else involved in the accident sustained injuries, it's essential to seek medical attention. Injuries may not be immediately apparent, so a medical evaluation is important for documenting any health issues related to the accident."

These forms are available online on the income tax portal or at the Western Union agent’s office. You may also have to submit a copy of your PAN card and a valid ID proof.If you received the money in cash, you may not have to fill out these forms, but you may still have to keep a record of the transaction details, such as the sender’s name, address, and country, the amount and currency of the money, the date and mode of receipt, and the purpose of the money.

    "question": "Does daughter have any right in father's business run by brother after father's death",
    "answer": "You have the right to claim your share in your father’s business, as well as the profits he earned after his death. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, as amended in 2005, daughters have equal rights as sons in their father’s property, whether it is ancestral or self-acquired. Since your father died without a will, his property will be divided equally among his legal heirs, which include you, your brother, and your mother (if she is alive). Therefore, you can file a suit for partition and accounting of the business, and demand your share of the assets and profits. You can also ask for the books of accounts and other documents related to the business, to verify the income and expenditure of the business.However, you will have to file the suit in Imphal, where the business is located and where your brother resides. The jurisdiction of a civil suit is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business. Since both these factors are in Imphal, you cannot file the suit in Delhi. You will have to engage a lawyer in Imphal who can represent you in the court there. You can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Imphal, if you are eligible for it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,Inheritance Rights: In the absence of a will, the inheritance laws of the state where your father resided and owned the business would typically apply. These laws determine how your father's assets, including the shoe shop, are distributed among his legal heirs. You and your siblings may have a legitimate claim to a share of the business as his legal heirs.Types of Legal Actions:You can file a suit for partition to claim your rightful share of the business's assets.You may also request an account of the business's financial transactions and profits to assess the value of your share.Location for Filing Suit: The location for filing the suit would generally be in the jurisdiction where the business is located, which, in this case, is Imphal, Manipur. It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Imphal who specializes in property and inheritance law. They can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements for your case.Legal Counsel: It's crucial to seek legal counsel to navigate this situation effectively. A lawyer can help you understand your rights, draft necessary legal documents, and represent your interests in court if required."

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Renting a flat for fiancee",
    "answer": "Renting a property in India as an unmarried couple is legal, but it may depend on the state and local laws, as well as the discretion of the landlord. You should be aware that while renting a property, you must create a rent agreement in the names of both parties and get it duly signed by them to safeguard your rights for the future. The rent agreement should also mention the ratio of the rent amount paid by each party and the mode of payment. You may also need to provide proof of identity and address for both of you, such as passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, etc.If you want to use the rent agreement to update your address on your documents for passport purpose, you should make sure that the agreement is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has a stamp duty paid on it. A registered rent agreement is a valid proof of address for passport application.Your backup plan of renting the property only under your name but having the full rent amount paid by your American fiancée may not be advisable, as it may raise suspicion from the landlord and the authorities. It may also create problems for you in proving your lawful tenancy and claiming your rights in case of any dispute.

    "answer": "Dear client,Termination Letter Validity:The validity of a termination letter without a name and designation of an authorized officer may vary by jurisdiction and employment contract. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply in your case.Appropriate Court:The appropriate court to challenge your termination would depend on the nature of your case and local labor laws. Typically, employment-related disputes are taken to the Labor Court or Industrial Tribunal. Consult with a labor lawyer to determine the best course of action.Cheating and Criminal Conspiracy:To pursue a case of cheating (Section 420) and criminal conspiracy, you would need to gather evidence that demonstrates fraudulent intent on the part of the bank. Consult with a criminal lawyer to assess the feasibility of such charges based on the facts of your case.Suit for Damages:You can consider filing a civil suit for damages if you believe you suffered financial harm due to the bank's actions. Consult with a civil lawyer to explore this option.Loan Payment:If you're unable to pay the loan due to circumstances beyond your control, you should communicate with the bank about your situation. They may be willing to offer temporary relief, such as a payment moratorium or restructuring of the loan. Consult with a financial advisor or legal professional to explore your options."

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the person who caused the damage to your brother’s car is liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of the accident. Section 140 of the Act deals with the principle of ‘no-fault liability’, which means that the owners of motor vehicles are liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of accidents caused by them, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. Section 163A of the Act provides for a structured formula for calculating the compensation amount based on various factors, such as age, income, disability, etc.Therefore, your brother has the right to claim compensation from the person who was driving the Innova that hit his car from behind. He can file a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Goa, where the accident took place or where he resides. He can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Goa, if he is eligible for it. He will have to submit relevant documents and evidence to prove his claim, such as FIR, medical reports, photographs, witnesses, etc. The MACT will then decide the amount of compensation after hearing both parties and examining the evidence.If your brother was badly injured in the accident, he can also claim compensation for his personal injury and medical expenses. He can also file a criminal case against the person who was driving the Innova for rash and negligent driving under Section 279 and 337 of theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These sections provide for imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs. 1000 or both. However, filing a criminal case may take longer and involve more procedures than filing a civil claim.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In many jurisdictions, if someone is responsible for a car accident due to their negligence or recklessness, they may be liable for the damages they cause. This typically includes damage to the vehicles involved, medical expenses for injuries, and other related costs. However, the specific rules and regulations can vary by location.In your brother's case, it's important to consider the following steps:Contact Insurance: Even if your brother's car is insured, he should report the accident to his insurance company. They can assess the damage and work on the claim, even if the other driver is at fault.Police Report: Since the police were involved and a report was filed, this can be crucial in establishing the facts of the accident.Consult Legal Advice: If the other driver is not cooperating and your brother believes he is not getting the compensation he deserves, he may want to consult with a personal injury attorney or a lawyer specializing in car accidents. They can advise him on the best course of action based on local laws.Medical Evaluation: If your brother or anyone else involved in the accident sustained injuries, it's essential to seek medical attention. Injuries may not be immediately apparent, so a medical evaluation is important for documenting any health issues related to the accident."

    "question": "Does daughter have any right in father's business run by brother after father's death",
    "answer": "You have the right to claim your share in your father’s business, as well as the profits he earned after his death. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, as amended in 2005, daughters have equal rights as sons in their father’s property, whether it is ancestral or self-acquired. Since your father died without a will, his property will be divided equally among his legal heirs, which include you, your brother, and your mother (if she is alive). Therefore, you can file a suit for partition and accounting of the business, and demand your share of the assets and profits. You can also ask for the books of accounts and other documents related to the business, to verify the income and expenditure of the business.However, you will have to file the suit in Imphal, where the business is located and where your brother resides. The jurisdiction of a civil suit is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business. Since both these factors are in Imphal, you cannot file the suit in Delhi. You will have to engage a lawyer in Imphal who can represent you in the court there. You can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Imphal, if you are eligible for it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

These laws determine how your father's assets, including the shoe shop, are distributed among his legal heirs. You and your siblings may have a legitimate claim to a share of the business as his legal heirs.Types of Legal Actions:You can file a suit for partition to claim your rightful share of the business's assets.You may also request an account of the business's financial transactions and profits to assess the value of your share.Location for Filing Suit: The location for filing the suit would generally be in the jurisdiction where the business is located, which, in this case, is Imphal, Manipur. It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Imphal who specializes in property and inheritance law. They can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements for your case.Legal Counsel: It's crucial to seek legal counsel to navigate this situation effectively.

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit. It's best to have a reasonable amount in your bank account to demonstrate financial sufficiency.Remember that visa requirements can change, and it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by the Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine when applying for your visa."

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months.

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit.

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can framer gift his agricultural land to non agriculturist",
    "answer": "A farmer cannot gift his agricultural land to a non-agriculturist in Maharashtra, unless he obtains the prior permission of the District Collector. This is because Section 63 of the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 prohibits the sale, gift, exchange or lease of any agricultural land in favour of a person who is not an agriculturist.According to the web search results, a non-agriculturist can buy agricultural land in Maharashtra only if he falls under any of the following categories:He is an agriculturist in any other state of India and can produce a farmer’s certificate and a copy of land record in which his name is mutated.He is a descendant of an agriculturist in Maharashtra or any other state of India and can prove his lineage through relevant documents.He has obtained the prior permission of the District Collector by fulfilling certain conditions, such as having a minimum educational qualification, having sufficient income from sources other than agriculture, having a genuine interest in farming, etc.To buy agricultural land in Maharashtra, a non-agriculturist also needs to follow certain steps and procedures, such as:Finding a suitable agricultural land for sale and verifying its title, ownership, encumbrances, land use, etc. through online portals or offline sources.Negotiating the price and terms and conditions of the sale with the seller and drafting a sale agreement with the help of a legal advisor.Paying the stamp duty and registration fees as per the market value of the land and registering the sale deed at the sub-registrar’s office.Getting the mutation done in the revenue records and obtaining the 7/12 extract and 8A extract from the tehsildar’s office.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can framer gift his agricultural land to non agriculturist",
    "answer": "A farmer cannot gift his agricultural land to a non-agriculturist in Maharashtra, unless he obtains the prior permission of the District Collector. This is because Section 63 of the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 prohibits the sale, gift, exchange or lease of any agricultural land in favour of a person who is not an agriculturist.According to the web search results, a non-agriculturist can buy agricultural land in Maharashtra only if he falls under any of the following categories:He is an agriculturist in any other state of India and can produce a farmer’s certificate and a copy of land record in which his name is mutated.He is a descendant of an agriculturist in Maharashtra or any other state of India and can prove his lineage through relevant documents.He has obtained the prior permission of the District Collector by fulfilling certain conditions, such as having a minimum educational qualification, having sufficient income from sources other than agriculture, having a genuine interest in farming, etc.To buy agricultural land in Maharashtra, a non-agriculturist also needs to follow certain steps and procedures, such as:Finding a suitable agricultural land for sale and verifying its title, ownership, encumbrances, land use, etc. through online portals or offline sources.Negotiating the price and terms and conditions of the sale with the seller and drafting a sale agreement with the help of a legal advisor.Paying the stamp duty and registration fees as per the market value of the land and registering the sale deed at the sub-registrar’s office.Getting the mutation done in the revenue records and obtaining the 7/12 extract and 8A extract from the tehsildar’s office.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This is because Section 63 of the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 prohibits the sale, gift, exchange or lease of any agricultural land in favour of a person who is not an agriculturist.According to the web search results, a non-agriculturist can buy agricultural land in Maharashtra only if he falls under any of the following categories:He is an agriculturist in any other state of India and can produce a farmer’s certificate and a copy of land record in which his name is mutated.He is a descendant of an agriculturist in Maharashtra or any other state of India and can prove his lineage through relevant documents.He has obtained the prior permission of the District Collector by fulfilling certain conditions, such as having a minimum educational qualification, having sufficient income from sources other than agriculture, having a genuine interest in farming, etc.To buy agricultural land in Maharashtra, a non-agriculturist also needs to follow certain steps and procedures, such as:Finding a suitable agricultural land for sale and verifying its title, ownership, encumbrances, land use, etc. through online portals or offline sources.Negotiating the price and terms and conditions of the sale with the seller and drafting a sale agreement with the help of a legal advisor.Paying the stamp duty and registration fees as per the market value of the land and registering the sale deed at the sub-registrar’s office.Getting the mutation done in the revenue records and obtaining the 7/12 extract and 8A extract from the tehsildar’s office.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "PPF account continues to earn interest as per the terms even after the death of the accountholder until the amount is claimed.” In this case,the nominee or the legal heir of the subscribercan claim the PPF amount.Was your deceased brother a bank employee?If not then why should bank disburse the amount to the nominees\"If the PPF subscriber had registered a valid nomination, the nominee will be able to claim the proceeds from the account by simply filing the Form G, along with proof of death of the subscriber (death certificate).\\Upon receipt of application and documents from the nominee, if these are found to be in order, all amounts standing to the credit of the PPF account of the deceased subscriber will be repaid to the nominee by the bank or post office. Adjustments will be made according to interest on loans taken by the subscriber.In fact the nominee in PPF is just a trustee.All the nominee gets is the right of ownership in terms of an authority to collect the money on the death of the subscriber and retain the money as a trustee for the benefit of the persons who are entitled to it under the law.In your brother's case also you and your brother are empowered to receive money on behalf of the legal heirs of your deceased brother and not to take the money yourself.A legal heir can claim the proceeds of a PPF account even when a nomination has been made to someone else, by producing the succession certificate.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Urgent assistance required for PPF account nominee dispute",
    "answer": "A nominee is a person who receives the PPF amount on behalf of the legal heirs of the deceased account holder. The nominee does not have any right or ownership over the PPF amount, but only acts as a trustee or custodian of the money until it is distributed among the legal heirs as per the succession laws or the will of the deceased.If there are more than one nominee in a PPF account, they have to jointly apply for withdrawal of the PPF amount by submitting Form G along with the death certificate of the account holder and their identity proofs to the bank or post office where the account is held. The bank or post office will then issue a cheque or demand draft in favour of all the nominees, who have to endorse it jointly and deposit it in their joint account.Based on this information, it seems that you cannot withdraw your brother’s PPF amount without the cooperation of your elder brother, who is also a nominee. However, you can try to resolve this issue by taking the following steps:You can send a legal notice to your elder brother through a lawyer, requesting him to join you in applying for withdrawal of the PPF amount within a reasonable time period. You can also inform him that if he fails to do so, you will take legal action against him for breach of trust and causing you financial loss and mental harassment.You can also approach the bank or post office where your brother’s PPF account is held and explain your situation to them. You can request them to issue separate cheques or demand drafts for each nominee’s share of the PPF amount, instead of a single cheque or demand draft for both nominees. However, this may depend on their discretion and policy.You can also seek mediation or arbitration from a third party, such as a mutual friend, relative, or a professional mediator or arbitrator, who can help you and your elder brother reach an amicable settlement and avoid further litigation. You can find more information about mediation and arbitration services in India from this website.If none of the above steps work, you can file a civil suit against your elder brother in the appropriate court, seeking an injunction to restrain him from obstructing your right to withdraw your share of the PPF amount and a direction to him to cooperate with you in completing the necessary formalities. You can also claim damages for the loss and inconvenience caused by his conduct.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Prestige Waterford - Land dispute and builder indemnification",
    "answer": "The worst case scenario in this case could be that the court finds that the sellers have indeed encroached on the lake land or forged the documents, and orders them to vacate the land and demolish the project. This could result in a loss of your investment and legal troubles for you as a buyer.The risk to you as a buyer under such a scenario depends on the terms and conditions of your sale agreement with the sellers and the builder. You may have to check if there is any clause that protects your rights and interests in case of such an eventuality. You may also have to consult a lawyer to understand your legal options and remedies.The indemnity clause that you have mentioned may provide some protection to you, but it may not be sufficient or enforceable in all situations. For example, if the sellers are unable to pay the compensation or if they go bankrupt, you may not be able to recover your money. Also, if the court finds that you were aware of the disputes and still bought the property, you may not be able to claim indemnity. Therefore, it is advisable to seek legal advice before relying on such a clause.Reselling the property may be of concern if the litigations are not concluded, as it may affect the market value and demand for the property. You may also face difficulties in finding buyers who are willing to take the risk of buying a disputed property. Moreover, you may have to disclose the pending litigations to the prospective buyers, as per the law.There are many precedents of similar cases where buyers have suffered due to land disputes and builder defaults. For instance, in 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes in Kochi that were built on a coastal zone in violation of environmental norms. The court also directed the builder to pay Rs 25 lakh each to 140 buyers who had invested in the project. Similarly, in 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the cancellation of registration of Amrapali Group, a real estate company that had failed to deliver flats to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida. The court also directed the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to complete the pending projects and appointed a receiver to manage the affairs of the company.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Prestige Waterford - Land dispute and builder indemnification",
    "answer": "Dear ClientWorst Case Scenario:The worst-case scenario in this case would likely involve a protracted legal battle with ongoing litigation surrounding the property. This could result in a significant delay in your ability to possess and use the property as intended. In the most extreme case, you may lose ownership rights to the property if the court rules against the sellers and finds that the property was obtained fraudulently.Risk to the Buyer:As the buyer, you could face several risks in this scenario:Delayed Possession: You may not be able to take possession of the property as planned due to the ongoing legal disputes.Financial Costs: You may incur legal expenses and costs related to defending your ownership rights or settling disputes.Uncertainty: There could be uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and you may not have clear title to the property until the disputes are resolved.Indemnity Clause:The indemnity clause you mentioned is a protective measure that can offer you some recourse if you face losses due to encumbrances or legal disputes related to the property. However, the effectiveness of the clause depends on the financial strength of the sellers and their ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific terms and conditions of this clause and how it would apply in your situation.Reselling the Property:Reselling the property in the midst of ongoing litigation can be challenging. Potential buyers may be hesitant to purchase a property with unresolved legal issues, and you may not be able to get a fair market price until the disputes are resolved. You should also consider potential legal obligations and liabilities when reselling the property.Precedents:It's possible that there are similar cases where buyers have faced difficulties due to property disputes. However, each case is unique, and outcomes can vary based on the specific facts and legal arguments presented. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law in India can provide you with more information on any relevant precedents and how they might apply to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Adjustments will be made according to interest on loans taken by the subscriber.In fact the nominee in PPF is just a trustee.All the nominee gets is the right of ownership in terms of an authority to collect the money on the death of the subscriber and retain the money as a trustee for the benefit of the persons who are entitled to it under the law.In your brother's case also you and your brother are empowered to receive money on behalf of the legal heirs of your deceased brother and not to take the money yourself.A legal heir can claim the proceeds of a PPF account even when a nomination has been made to someone else, by producing the succession certificate.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Urgent assistance required for PPF account nominee dispute",
    "answer": "A nominee is a person who receives the PPF amount on behalf of the legal heirs of the deceased account holder. The nominee does not have any right or ownership over the PPF amount, but only acts as a trustee or custodian of the money until it is distributed among the legal heirs as per the succession laws or the will of the deceased.If there are more than one nominee in a PPF account, they have to jointly apply for withdrawal of the PPF amount by submitting Form G along with the death certificate of the account holder and their identity proofs to the bank or post office where the account is held. The bank or post office will then issue a cheque or demand draft in favour of all the nominees, who have to endorse it jointly and deposit it in their joint account.Based on this information, it seems that you cannot withdraw your brother’s PPF amount without the cooperation of your elder brother, who is also a nominee. However, you can try to resolve this issue by taking the following steps:You can send a legal notice to your elder brother through a lawyer, requesting him to join you in applying for withdrawal of the PPF amount within a reasonable time period. You can also inform him that if he fails to do so, you will take legal action against him for breach of trust and causing you financial loss and mental harassment.You can also approach the bank or post office where your brother’s PPF account is held and explain your situation to them. You can request them to issue separate cheques or demand drafts for each nominee’s share of the PPF amount, instead of a single cheque or demand draft for both nominees. However, this may depend on their discretion and policy.You can also seek mediation or arbitration from a third party, such as a mutual friend, relative, or a professional mediator or arbitrator, who can help you and your elder brother reach an amicable settlement and avoid further litigation. You can find more information about mediation and arbitration services in India from this website.If none of the above steps work, you can file a civil suit against your elder brother in the appropriate court, seeking an injunction to restrain him from obstructing your right to withdraw your share of the PPF amount and a direction to him to cooperate with you in completing the necessary formalities. You can also claim damages for the loss and inconvenience caused by his conduct.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "One of the famous gyms forcing me put biometric otherwise we don't allow you saying is this legal",
    "answer": "In India, biometric and digital personal data are forms of sensitive data requiring heightened levels of protection and consent. Historically, the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (Privacy Rules) governed the collection, storage, and handling of such data. More recently, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act or DPDPA-2023) has come into play.According to both the Privacy Rules and the DPDP Act, any person or entity that collects, receives, possesses, stores, deals, or handles biometric or digital personal data must obtain prior consent from the person providing such data. A comprehensive privacy policy must be disclosed, outlining the purpose of collection, intended usage, retention period, security practices, and grievance redressal mechanisms.Obligations and Rights under the DPDP Act:Data principals (the individuals whose data is being collected) have the right to access, correct, erase, port, and restrict their digital personal data.Data fiduciaries (the entities processing the data) have obligations to classify their data into general, sensitive, and critical categories and abide by varying rules for each.Data fiduciaries are mandated to conduct data protection impact assessments, appoint data protection officers, and conduct periodic audits.They must notify the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the affected data principals in case of a data breach.Data fiduciaries must also adhere to the codes of practice, standards, and regulations issued by the DPA.Explicit consent is required for processing sensitive digital personal data, and additional conditions must be met for cross-border data transfer.For processing critical digital personal data, prior approval from the DPA is mandatory, and a copy of such data must be stored within India.If your gym or any other entity violates these conditions, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority (under the IT Act) or the Data Protection Authority (under the DPDP Act), and you may also seek legal remedies. For further information, you may refer to the DNA Technology Regulation Bill, which pertains to the use of DNA information in particular cases but has sparked some privacy debates, as well as the official website of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for guidelines on the DPDP Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientReview the Gym Membership Agreement:Carefully review the terms and conditions of your gym membership agreement. This document should outline the rights and responsibilities of both you and the gym. Look for any clauses related to biometric data collection, privacy, and membership requirements.Seek Legal Advice:Consult with a lawyer who specializes in privacy and data protection laws in India. They can provide you with advice on whether the gym's demand for biometric data is in compliance with Indian laws.Check Privacy Laws:India has enacted the Aadhaar Act, which regulates the collection and use of biometric data. Determine whether the gym's actions are in violation of this or other applicable privacy laws.Negotiate with the Gym:Attempt to negotiate with the gym management to find an alternative solution. Explain your concerns and try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that doesn't involve providing biometric data.Raise a Complaint:If negotiations fail and you believe your rights are being violated, you can consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities. In India, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) oversees Aadhaar-related matters, and you can file a complaint with them if necessary.Consider Legal Action:If you believe your rights have been infringed upon, you may choose to take legal action against the gym.

    "question": "Different Name on Allotment letter",
    "answer": "You may need to take some steps to rectify the error in the name of the seller on the allotment letter and the builder buyer agreement. Some of the steps are:For the builder buyer agreement, which is registered, you can go for a rectification deed, as you have mentioned. A rectification deed is a legal document that allows you to correct any mistakes or errors in the original deed, such as spelling mistakes or typographical errors. A rectification deed must be executed by both parties and registered with the same sub-registrar where the original deed was registered. You may also have to pay a nominal stamp duty and registration fee for the rectification deed.For the allotment letter, which is not registered, you can request the builder to issue a revised allotment letter with the correct name of the seller. You may have to submit an application along with a copy of the original allotment letter and proof of identity of the seller. The builder may charge a nominal fee for issuing a revised allotment letter. Alternatively, you can also take a dual name affidavit from the seller, as someone suggested. A dual name affidavit is a sworn statement that confirms that two different names belong to one and the same person. The seller can execute a dual name affidavit before a notary public or a magistrate, stating that his name is Amandeep Sharma and he is also known as Amandeep Singh. He can also mention the reason for the difference in name and attach copies of his identity proofs, such as PAN card, Aadhar card, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Narasimha observed that courts would be entitled to take cognizance of a complaint or initiation of proceedings even after the prescribed period of limitation lapses.“It is … clear that though Section 468 of the Code mandates that ‘cognizance’ ought to be taken within the specified period from the commission of offence, by invoking the principles of purposive construction, this Court ruled that a complainant should not be put to prejudice, if for reasons beyond the control of the prosecuting agency or the complainant, the cognizance was taken after the period of limitation. It was observed by the Constitution Bench that if the filing of the complaint or initiation of proceedings was within the prescribed period from the date of commission of an offence, the Court would be entitled to take cognizance even after the prescribed period was over.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "There is no specific time limit for filing a complaint againstdomestic violence, but she must be able to prove that you were in a domestic relationship with the harasser at the time the violence took place.Courts can entertain applications filed under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct even beyond limitation period: Supreme Court.Section 468 of the CrPC envisages the period of limitation for taking cognizance of various offences based on the nature, and specifies one year for offences pertaining todomestic violence.The provisions of the Act contemplate filing of an application under Section 12 to initiate the proceedings before the concerned Magistrate. After hearing both sides and after taking into account the material on record, the Magistrate may pass an appropriate order under Section 12 of the Act. It is only the breach of such order which constitutes an offence as is clear from Section 31 of the Act. Thus, if there be any offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act, the limitation prescribed under Section 468 of the Code will apply from the date of commission of such offence. By the time an application is preferred under Section 12 of the Act, there is no offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act and as such there would never be a starting point for limitation from the date of application under Section 12 of the Act. Such a starting point for limitation would arise only and only after there is a breach of an order passed under Section 12 of the Act.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The limitation period prescribed under Section 468 of theCode of Criminal Procedureis not applicable for the filing of an application by an aggrieved woman under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. The Supreme Court held as erroneous a judgment of the Madras High Court which held that the Section 12 application ought to be filed within 1 year of the act(s) ofdomestic violence, failing which, such application is not maintainable.The Supreme Court observed that an application under Section 12 of the DV Act cannot be treated as an application with respect to an offence. An offence under the DV Act arises only after the order passed under Section 12 is violated under Section 31 of the Act. A notice issued under Section 12 of the Act cannot be regarded as taking cognizance of the offence. Therefore, the provisions of CrPC relating to limitation are not applicable to such applications.Based on this information, it seems that you cannot rely on Section 468 of CrPC to dismiss your wife’s case on the ground of delay. However, you can still challenge her case on other grounds, such as lack of evidence, false allegations, mala fide intention, etc. You can also try to prove that there was nodomestic violencecommitted by you and that your wife is not entitled to any relief under the DV Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, if you want to evict a tenant from a commercial property, you can file an Eviction Suit under the relevant state-specific Rent Control Laws or theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. Here are some key points to consider:Eviction Suit Timeline:The timeline for filing an Eviction Suit can vary depending on several factors, including court procedures and the specific circumstances of your case.Generally, it's advisable to start the process as soon as possible, especially if the tenant is in unauthorized possession of the property after the lease has expired.The specific timeline for your case can be provided by a legal expert who is familiar with local court procedures.Cost of Filing an Eviction Suit:The cost of filing an Eviction Suit may include court fees, legal fees, and other incidental expenses.The exact cost can vary based on the property's value and location and the lawyer's fees. It's best to consult with a lawyer for a precise estimate.Validity of Email Notices:Indian courts generally prefer physical service of notices as opposed to electronic means like email. However, laws and practices may evolve over time.While email notices may not be considered a valid method of service in most cases, you can still use them as supplementary evidence to show that you attempted to inform the tenant about the eviction.Consult with a legal expert to understand if there have been any recent developments in the acceptance of email notices in your jurisdiction.Establishing Service When Notices Are Returned:If notices served by Speed Post are returned undelivered, you should retain these returned notices as evidence of your attempt to serve them.You can also consider alternative methods of service, such as publishing notice in local newspapers or affixing the notice to a conspicuous part of the property, with court permission.Consult with a lawyer to explore the best course of action in your specific situation.To proceed with an Eviction Suit, you should engage a local lawyer who specializes in property and real estate matters. They will guide you through the legal process, help you draft the necessary legal documents, and represent you in court if requiredAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Eviction of Lessee from a commercial property in South-Kolkata after Lease Expiry in 2012",
    "answer": "You can file an eviction suit against the lessee under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (the Act), which governs the relationship between landlords and tenants of commercial properties in West Bengal. The Act provides various grounds for eviction, such as default in payment of rent, subletting without consent, causing damage to the property, using the property for illegal or immoral purposes, etc.However, since your case involves a lease that has expired and not been renewed, you may have to file a suit for recovery of possession under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 (the TPA), which governs the transfer of immovable property in India. The TPA provides that a lease of immovable property determines by efflux of time limited thereby, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the lease. Therefore, if your lease deed does not contain any clause for renewal or extension of the lease, you can claim possession of your property after the expiry of the lease term.To file an eviction suit or a suit for recovery of possession, you will need to engage a lawyer who can draft and file the plaint on your behalf. You will also need to pay the court fees and stamp duty as per the schedule prescribed by the West Bengal Court Fees Act, 1970 and the West Bengal Stamp Act, 1899. The amount of court fees and stamp duty will depend on the value of your property and the relief claimed by you. You can consult your lawyer for more details on this.The timeline for filing and disposing of an eviction suit or a suit for recovery of possession may vary depending on various factors such as the complexity of your case, the availability of evidence and witnesses, the pendency of cases in the court, etc. However, generally speaking, it may take anywhere between 6 months to 3 years or more for a final verdict from the court.As for serving an eviction notice to your lessee, you can do so by sending it through registered post with acknowledgement due (RPAD) or speed post to his last known address. You can also send it through email if you have his email address and if he has consented to receive notices through email. However, you should also keep a hard copy of the notice and its proof of delivery as evidence in case of any dispute.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, she must make sure that the will is clear, unambiguous, and free from any undue influence or coercion. She must also sign the will in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign it.If your mother makes a will in your favor, you will inherit all the properties from her after her death. However, you may have to face some legal consequences if your siblings or their children challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They may claim that the will was not made by your mother voluntarily or that she was not of sound mind when she made it. They may also claim that the will was forged or tampered with or that they were not aware of its existence.To avoid such disputes, it is advisable that your mother informs your siblings and their children about her intention to make a will in your favor and explains her reasons for doing so. She may also send them a copy of the will after making it and ask them to acknowledge it. This may reduce the chances of any litigation in the future. Alternatively, she may also consider giving you a gift deed for the properties during her lifetime, which will transfer the ownership to you immediately and irrevocably. However, a gift deed may attract stamp duty and registration charges depending on the state where the properties are located.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property inheritance and wills are primarily governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and property laws specific to the state in which the property is located. Here are some key points to consider:Writing a Will: Your mother has the legal right to write a will and specify how her property should be distributed after her passing. She can choose to leave her property to you or any other beneficiary she wishes.Validity of the Will: To ensure the validity of the will, it should typically be executed in accordance with the law. It's advisable for your mother to consult with a lawyer to draft and execute the will properly. The will should clearly state her intentions, and it may not necessarily require your siblings to sign it.Challenging a Will: While your mother has the right to decide how to distribute her property, there is always the possibility that your siblings could challenge the will in court if they believe it was executed under duress, fraud, or other illegal circumstances. However, the burden of proof typically falls on the challenging party.Rights of Foreign Citizens: Your siblings, as U.S. citizens, can inherit property in India. However, they should be aware of Indian laws regarding property ownership by foreign citizens. It's important to consult with an Indian lawyer who can provide advice on the legal requirements and implications for foreign citizens inheriting Indian property.Legal Consultation: To navigate this situation successfully, it is strongly recommended that you and your mother consult with a qualified Indian lawyer who specializes in property law and succession planning. They can provide guidance on drafting the will, the legal requirements for its validity, and steps to minimize the risk of legal challenges.Tax Implications: Inheritance tax laws in India may also apply, so it's important to consult with a tax expert to understand any tax obligations associated with inheriting property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You can file an eviction suit against the lessee under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (the Act), which governs the relationship between landlords and tenants of commercial properties in West Bengal. The Act provides various grounds for eviction, such as default in payment of rent, subletting without consent, causing damage to the property, using the property for illegal or immoral purposes, etc.However, since your case involves a lease that has expired and not been renewed, you may have to file a suit for recovery of possession under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 (the TPA), which governs the transfer of immovable property in India. The TPA provides that a lease of immovable property determines by efflux of time limited thereby, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the lease. Therefore, if your lease deed does not contain any clause for renewal or extension of the lease, you can claim possession of your property after the expiry of the lease term.To file an eviction suit or a suit for recovery of possession, you will need to engage a lawyer who can draft and file the plaint on your behalf. You will also need to pay the court fees and stamp duty as per the schedule prescribed by the West Bengal Court Fees Act, 1970 and the West Bengal Stamp Act, 1899. The amount of court fees and stamp duty will depend on the value of your property and the relief claimed by you. You can consult your lawyer for more details on this.The timeline for filing and disposing of an eviction suit or a suit for recovery of possession may vary depending on various factors such as the complexity of your case, the availability of evidence and witnesses, the pendency of cases in the court, etc. However, generally speaking, it may take anywhere between 6 months to 3 years or more for a final verdict from the court.As for serving an eviction notice to your lessee, you can do so by sending it through registered post with acknowledgement due (RPAD) or speed post to his last known address. You can also send it through email if you have his email address and if he has consented to receive notices through email. However, you should also keep a hard copy of the notice and its proof of delivery as evidence in case of any dispute.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "First of all, you have the right to choose whether to marry or not. Live-in relationships are not illegal or immoral in India, and consenting adults have the right to cohabit without marriage. The Supreme Court has held that live-in relationships come within the ambit of Right to Life under Article 21 of theConstitution of India. Therefore, you cannot be forced to marry against your will by anyone, including your parents or boyfriend’s parents. If you feel threatened or harassed by them, you can seek protection from the police or the court.Secondly, you have certain rights as a live-in partner, especially if your relationship fulfills certain conditions laid down by the Supreme Court. These rights include:Right to maintenance under section 125 ofCriminal Procedure Code, 1973. You can claim financial support from your boyfriend if he refuses or neglects to maintain you adequately.Rights given under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. You can seek relief from any form ofdomestic violence, including physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, or economic abuse, by your boyfriend or his family members.Right to property under theHindu Succession Act, 2005. You can claim a share in your boyfriend’s ancestral or self-acquired property if you can prove that you have contributed to it financially or otherwise.Right to visa extension if you are a foreign national living with an Indian citizen. You can apply for a long-term visa based on your live-in relationship.Thirdly, your child has certain rights as well, regardless of whether you marry or not. These rights include:Right to maintenance from both parents under section 125 ofCriminal Procedure Code, 1973. You and your boyfriend are legally bound to provide for your child’s basic needs and education.Right to inheritance from both parents under section 16 ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Your child is considered legitimate and has equal rights as any other child born in a lawful wedlock.Right to father’s name and identity under section 112 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Your child can claim paternity from your boyfriend if there is no evidence to the contrary.These are some of the legal rights that you and your child have in a live-in relationship in India. However, these rights are not absolute and may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.

    "answer": "1. First of all you can't be forced to marry him against your willingness.Even by chance if you are forced to get married,  you can immediately file an annulment petition to annul your marriage.If you don't take any action but leaving his house, it is not necessary that he has to file a RCR case against you.Even if he files one, the court will hear your objection and then pass an order on merits.It is not necessary that he has to file an execution petition to execute the decree.Even if he files an execution petition,  if there's no property on your name,  he cannot proceed further to get your bank deposit attached,  it is not legally permissible.2. If he's employed and having sufficient source of income,  he cannot claim maintenance from you.3. He cannot because he is having more income than you.You can always take the child to your custody.4.

    "question": "Restitution of conjugal rights and its financial implications",
    "answer": "Dear ClientAttachment of Property and Income: In the event of aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) decree, the court can order the attachment of property, income, or bank accounts of the party against whom the decree is issued. The extent of attachment can vary, and it depends on the court's decision based on factors such as your income, expenses, and the needs of the other party. Attachment typically lasts for the duration of the court proceedings, but it can be extended for special reasons.Maintenance from You: Your husband can seek maintenance from you if you are living separately. The amount of maintenance is determined by the court and is based on factors such as your husband's income, your income, and the needs and expenses of both parties. The court will consider the circumstances and merits of the case before making a decision.Child Alimony: Child custody and child support are separate issues from maintenance. The court will decide on child custody and the amount of child support based on the best interests of the child. The amount of child support can vary depending on factors such as the child's needs, your and your boyfriend's incomes, and other relevant circumstances.Repayment of Wedding Expenses: Whether your father-in-law can seek repayment of wedding expenses would depend on the specific circumstances and any agreements that were made at the time of the wedding. It's possible that if there was a specific understanding or agreement regarding repayment of wedding expenses, it could be pursued legally. However, this would be a matter for legal examination and may require evidence of such an agreement.Financially, the decision to marry or not should be based on your individual circumstances, including your relationship with your boyfriend and his family, your own financial situation, and your future plans.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here are some key points to consider:Eviction Suit Timeline:The timeline for filing an Eviction Suit can vary depending on several factors, including court procedures and the specific circumstances of your case.Generally, it's advisable to start the process as soon as possible, especially if the tenant is in unauthorized possession of the property after the lease has expired.The specific timeline for your case can be provided by a legal expert who is familiar with local court procedures.Cost of Filing an Eviction Suit:The cost of filing an Eviction Suit may include court fees, legal fees, and other incidental expenses.The exact cost can vary based on the property's value and location and the lawyer's fees. It's best to consult with a lawyer for a precise estimate.Validity of Email Notices:Indian courts generally prefer physical service of notices as opposed to electronic means like email. However, laws and practices may evolve over time.While email notices may not be considered a valid method of service in most cases, you can still use them as supplementary evidence to show that you attempted to inform the tenant about the eviction.Consult with a legal expert to understand if there have been any recent developments in the acceptance of email notices in your jurisdiction.Establishing Service When Notices Are Returned:If notices served by Speed Post are returned undelivered, you should retain these returned notices as evidence of your attempt to serve them.You can also consider alternative methods of service, such as publishing notice in local newspapers or affixing the notice to a conspicuous part of the property, with court permission.Consult with a lawyer to explore the best course of action in your specific situation.To proceed with an Eviction Suit, you should engage a local lawyer who specializes in property and real estate matters.

    "question": "Eviction of Lessee from a commercial property in South-Kolkata after Lease Expiry in 2012",
    "answer": "You can file an eviction suit against the lessee under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (the Act), which governs the relationship between landlords and tenants of commercial properties in West Bengal. The Act provides various grounds for eviction, such as default in payment of rent, subletting without consent, causing damage to the property, using the property for illegal or immoral purposes, etc.However, since your case involves a lease that has expired and not been renewed, you may have to file a suit for recovery of possession under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 (the TPA), which governs the transfer of immovable property in India. The TPA provides that a lease of immovable property determines by efflux of time limited thereby, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the lease. Therefore, if your lease deed does not contain any clause for renewal or extension of the lease, you can claim possession of your property after the expiry of the lease term.To file an eviction suit or a suit for recovery of possession, you will need to engage a lawyer who can draft and file the plaint on your behalf. You will also need to pay the court fees and stamp duty as per the schedule prescribed by the West Bengal Court Fees Act, 1970 and the West Bengal Stamp Act, 1899. The amount of court fees and stamp duty will depend on the value of your property and the relief claimed by you. You can consult your lawyer for more details on this.The timeline for filing and disposing of an eviction suit or a suit for recovery of possession may vary depending on various factors such as the complexity of your case, the availability of evidence and witnesses, the pendency of cases in the court, etc. However, generally speaking, it may take anywhere between 6 months to 3 years or more for a final verdict from the court.As for serving an eviction notice to your lessee, you can do so by sending it through registered post with acknowledgement due (RPAD) or speed post to his last known address. You can also send it through email if you have his email address and if he has consented to receive notices through email. However, you should also keep a hard copy of the notice and its proof of delivery as evidence in case of any dispute.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

They can guide you through the legal process and provide you with the best possible advice.Bail Application: If you or your family members have been arrested, your lawyer can file for bail to secure your release from custody. In many cases, bail can be granted if there's no substantial evidence against you, and the charges appear to be false.Collect Evidence: Work with your lawyer to gather evidence that can prove your innocence. This may include gathering witnesses who can vouch for your whereabouts at the time of the alleged incident, collecting any relevant documents, and obtaining any CCTV footage or other evidence that can support your defense.Challenge the Medical Certificate: If a fake medical certificate has been submitted, your lawyer can challenge its authenticity in court. This may involve obtaining a genuine medical opinion to counter the false certificate.Cross-Examine Witnesses: If the rich person's workers are being presented as witnesses, your lawyer can cross-examine them to expose any inconsistencies or contradictions in their statements.File a Counter Complaint: If you believe that the false charges were filed maliciously, you may consider filing a counter complaint against the individuals who filed the false charges or against the police officers who took bribes, if you have evidence to support such allegations.Seek Legal Remedies Against Police Misconduct: If there is evidence of police misconduct, such as taking bribes or filing false charges, you can pursue legal remedies against the officers involved. This might involve filing a complaint with higher-ranking police officials or approaching the courts to seek appropriate action.Maintain a Record: Keep a detailed record of all interactions related to the case, including conversations with your lawyer, court proceedings, and any evidence collected. This documentation can be crucial in building a strong defense.Attend Court Hearings: Make sure you and your family members attend all court hearings as required. Failure to appear can result in adverse consequences.Stay Informed: Stay informed about the progress of your case and follow the advice of your lawyer closely. Legal procedures in India can be complex, so it's essential to rely on professional guidance.IPC Section 323: Punishment for Voluntarily Causing HurtThis section deals with cases where a person voluntarily causes hurt to another. The punishment for this offense is imprisonment for up to one year or a fine, or both.Defense strategies:Self-defense: If you can establish that you caused hurt in self-defense, it may be a valid defense.Lack of intention: If it can be demonstrated that you did not intend to cause hurt, this could be a defense.Consent: If the victim consented to the actions that caused the hurt, this might be a defense.IPC Section 506: Punishment for Criminal IntimidationSection 506deals with the offense of criminal intimidation.

In such cases, each person is liable as if they had committed the act alone.Defense strategies:Lack of common intention: If it can be proven that there was no common intention among the accused, this defense may be applicable.Alibi: If you can establish that you were not present at the scene or were not involved in the alleged criminal act, this could be a defense.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What is the best defence for IPC 323,506,34",
    "answer": "According toSection 323of theIndian Penal Code, whoever voluntarily causes hurt to any person shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.According toSection 506of theIndian Penal Code, whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. If the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to burn or destroy any property, or to accuse any person of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or to impute unchastity to a woman, then the punishment may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.According to Section 34 of theIndian Penal Code, when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.Based on this information, it seems that you are charged with causing hurt and intimidation to the complainant along with four other members of your family who had a common intention to do so. However, you can defend yourself against these charges by proving that they are false and fabricated by the complainant and the cops who took bribe from him. You can also challenge the fake medical certificate and the witnesses of the complainant by producing your own evidence and witnesses to show that you were not present at the spot at that time and that there was no physical violence or threat involved in the verbal abuse between your parents and the complainant.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court has held that the limitation period prescribed under Section 468 of theCode of Criminal Procedureis not applicable for the filing of an application by an aggrieved woman under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.2)Reiterating the principle mentioned by a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inSarah Mathew vs. The Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases & Ors. (2013), a bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and P.S. Narasimha observed that courts would be entitled to take cognizance of a complaint or initiation of proceedings even after the prescribed period of limitation lapses.“It is … clear that though Section 468 of the Code mandates that ‘cognizance’ ought to be taken within the specified period from the commission of offence, by invoking the principles of purposive construction, this Court ruled that a complainant should not be put to prejudice, if for reasons beyond the control of the prosecuting agency or the complainant, the cognizance was taken after the period of limitation. It was observed by the Constitution Bench that if the filing of the complaint or initiation of proceedings was within the prescribed period from the date of commission of an offence, the Court would be entitled to take cognizance even after the prescribed period was over.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Wife has filed dv sec 12 case 2 yrs after seperation. Will crpc 468 limit apply, How to fight this?",
    "answer": "There is no specific time limit for filing a complaint againstdomestic violence, but she must be able to prove that you were in a domestic relationship with the harasser at the time the violence took place.Courts can entertain applications filed under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct even beyond limitation period: Supreme Court.Section 468 of the CrPC envisages the period of limitation for taking cognizance of various offences based on the nature, and specifies one year for offences pertaining todomestic violence.The provisions of the Act contemplate filing of an application under Section 12 to initiate the proceedings before the concerned Magistrate. After hearing both sides and after taking into account the material on record, the Magistrate may pass an appropriate order under Section 12 of the Act. It is only the breach of such order which constitutes an offence as is clear from Section 31 of the Act. Thus, if there be any offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act, the limitation prescribed under Section 468 of the Code will apply from the date of commission of such offence. By the time an application is preferred under Section 12 of the Act, there is no offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act and as such there would never be a starting point for limitation from the date of application under Section 12 of the Act. Such a starting point for limitation would arise only and only after there is a breach of an order passed under Section 12 of the Act.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The limitation period prescribed under Section 468 of theCode of Criminal Procedureis not applicable for the filing of an application by an aggrieved woman under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. The Supreme Court held as erroneous a judgment of the Madras High Court which held that the Section 12 application ought to be filed within 1 year of the act(s) ofdomestic violence, failing which, such application is not maintainable.The Supreme Court observed that an application under Section 12 of the DV Act cannot be treated as an application with respect to an offence. An offence under the DV Act arises only after the order passed under Section 12 is violated under Section 31 of the Act. A notice issued under Section 12 of the Act cannot be regarded as taking cognizance of the offence. Therefore, the provisions of CrPC relating to limitation are not applicable to such applications.Based on this information, it seems that you cannot rely on Section 468 of CrPC to dismiss your wife’s case on the ground of delay. However, you can still challenge her case on other grounds, such as lack of evidence, false allegations, mala fide intention, etc. You can also try to prove that there was nodomestic violencecommitted by you and that your wife is not entitled to any relief under the DV Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

They can guide you through the legal process and provide you with the best possible advice.Bail Application: If you or your family members have been arrested, your lawyer can file for bail to secure your release from custody. In many cases, bail can be granted if there's no substantial evidence against you, and the charges appear to be false.Collect Evidence: Work with your lawyer to gather evidence that can prove your innocence. This may include gathering witnesses who can vouch for your whereabouts at the time of the alleged incident, collecting any relevant documents, and obtaining any CCTV footage or other evidence that can support your defense.Challenge the Medical Certificate: If a fake medical certificate has been submitted, your lawyer can challenge its authenticity in court. This may involve obtaining a genuine medical opinion to counter the false certificate.Cross-Examine Witnesses: If the rich person's workers are being presented as witnesses, your lawyer can cross-examine them to expose any inconsistencies or contradictions in their statements.File a Counter Complaint: If you believe that the false charges were filed maliciously, you may consider filing a counter complaint against the individuals who filed the false charges or against the police officers who took bribes, if you have evidence to support such allegations.Seek Legal Remedies Against Police Misconduct: If there is evidence of police misconduct, such as taking bribes or filing false charges, you can pursue legal remedies against the officers involved. This might involve filing a complaint with higher-ranking police officials or approaching the courts to seek appropriate action.Maintain a Record: Keep a detailed record of all interactions related to the case, including conversations with your lawyer, court proceedings, and any evidence collected. This documentation can be crucial in building a strong defense.Attend Court Hearings: Make sure you and your family members attend all court hearings as required. Failure to appear can result in adverse consequences.Stay Informed: Stay informed about the progress of your case and follow the advice of your lawyer closely. Legal procedures in India can be complex, so it's essential to rely on professional guidance.IPC Section 323: Punishment for Voluntarily Causing HurtThis section deals with cases where a person voluntarily causes hurt to another.

In such cases, each person is liable as if they had committed the act alone.Defense strategies:Lack of common intention: If it can be proven that there was no common intention among the accused, this defense may be applicable.Alibi: If you can establish that you were not present at the scene or were not involved in the alleged criminal act, this could be a defense.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According toSection 323of theIndian Penal Code, whoever voluntarily causes hurt to any person shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.According toSection 506of theIndian Penal Code, whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. If the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to burn or destroy any property, or to accuse any person of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or to impute unchastity to a woman, then the punishment may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.According to Section 34 of theIndian Penal Code, when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.Based on this information, it seems that you are charged with causing hurt and intimidation to the complainant along with four other members of your family who had a common intention to do so. However, you can defend yourself against these charges by proving that they are false and fabricated by the complainant and the cops who took bribe from him. You can also challenge the fake medical certificate and the witnesses of the complainant by producing your own evidence and witnesses to show that you were not present at the spot at that time and that there was no physical violence or threat involved in the verbal abuse between your parents and the complainant.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Prestige Waterford - Land dispute and builder indemnification",
    "answer": "The worst case scenario in this case could be that the court finds that the sellers have indeed encroached on the lake land or forged the documents, and orders them to vacate the land and demolish the project. This could result in a loss of your investment and legal troubles for you as a buyer.The risk to you as a buyer under such a scenario depends on the terms and conditions of your sale agreement with the sellers and the builder. You may have to check if there is any clause that protects your rights and interests in case of such an eventuality. You may also have to consult a lawyer to understand your legal options and remedies.The indemnity clause that you have mentioned may provide some protection to you, but it may not be sufficient or enforceable in all situations. For example, if the sellers are unable to pay the compensation or if they go bankrupt, you may not be able to recover your money. Also, if the court finds that you were aware of the disputes and still bought the property, you may not be able to claim indemnity. Therefore, it is advisable to seek legal advice before relying on such a clause.Reselling the property may be of concern if the litigations are not concluded, as it may affect the market value and demand for the property. You may also face difficulties in finding buyers who are willing to take the risk of buying a disputed property. Moreover, you may have to disclose the pending litigations to the prospective buyers, as per the law.There are many precedents of similar cases where buyers have suffered due to land disputes and builder defaults. For instance, in 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes in Kochi that were built on a coastal zone in violation of environmental norms. The court also directed the builder to pay Rs 25 lakh each to 140 buyers who had invested in the project. Similarly, in 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the cancellation of registration of Amrapali Group, a real estate company that had failed to deliver flats to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida. The court also directed the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to complete the pending projects and appointed a receiver to manage the affairs of the company.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientWorst Case Scenario:The worst-case scenario in this case would likely involve a protracted legal battle with ongoing litigation surrounding the property. This could result in a significant delay in your ability to possess and use the property as intended. In the most extreme case, you may lose ownership rights to the property if the court rules against the sellers and finds that the property was obtained fraudulently.Risk to the Buyer:As the buyer, you could face several risks in this scenario:Delayed Possession: You may not be able to take possession of the property as planned due to the ongoing legal disputes.Financial Costs: You may incur legal expenses and costs related to defending your ownership rights or settling disputes.Uncertainty: There could be uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and you may not have clear title to the property until the disputes are resolved.Indemnity Clause:The indemnity clause you mentioned is a protective measure that can offer you some recourse if you face losses due to encumbrances or legal disputes related to the property. However, the effectiveness of the clause depends on the financial strength of the sellers and their ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific terms and conditions of this clause and how it would apply in your situation.Reselling the Property:Reselling the property in the midst of ongoing litigation can be challenging. Potential buyers may be hesitant to purchase a property with unresolved legal issues, and you may not be able to get a fair market price until the disputes are resolved. You should also consider potential legal obligations and liabilities when reselling the property.Precedents:It's possible that there are similar cases where buyers have faced difficulties due to property disputes. However, each case is unique, and outcomes can vary based on the specific facts and legal arguments presented. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law in India can provide you with more information on any relevant precedents and how they might apply to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, which applies to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists in India, your mother has the absolute right to dispose of her self-acquired property by a will as she wishes. She does not need the consent or signature of your siblings or their children to make a valid will. However, she must make sure that the will is clear, unambiguous, and free from any undue influence or coercion. She must also sign the will in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign it.If your mother makes a will in your favor, you will inherit all the properties from her after her death. However, you may have to face some legal consequences if your siblings or their children challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They may claim that the will was not made by your mother voluntarily or that she was not of sound mind when she made it. They may also claim that the will was forged or tampered with or that they were not aware of its existence.To avoid such disputes, it is advisable that your mother informs your siblings and their children about her intention to make a will in your favor and explains her reasons for doing so. She may also send them a copy of the will after making it and ask them to acknowledge it. This may reduce the chances of any litigation in the future. Alternatively, she may also consider giving you a gift deed for the properties during her lifetime, which will transfer the ownership to you immediately and irrevocably. However, a gift deed may attract stamp duty and registration charges depending on the state where the properties are located.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property inheritance and wills are primarily governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and property laws specific to the state in which the property is located. Here are some key points to consider:Writing a Will: Your mother has the legal right to write a will and specify how her property should be distributed after her passing. She can choose to leave her property to you or any other beneficiary she wishes.Validity of the Will: To ensure the validity of the will, it should typically be executed in accordance with the law. It's advisable for your mother to consult with a lawyer to draft and execute the will properly. The will should clearly state her intentions, and it may not necessarily require your siblings to sign it.Challenging a Will: While your mother has the right to decide how to distribute her property, there is always the possibility that your siblings could challenge the will in court if they believe it was executed under duress, fraud, or other illegal circumstances. However, the burden of proof typically falls on the challenging party.Rights of Foreign Citizens: Your siblings, as U.S. citizens, can inherit property in India. However, they should be aware of Indian laws regarding property ownership by foreign citizens. It's important to consult with an Indian lawyer who can provide advice on the legal requirements and implications for foreign citizens inheriting Indian property.Legal Consultation: To navigate this situation successfully, it is strongly recommended that you and your mother consult with a qualified Indian lawyer who specializes in property law and succession planning. They can provide guidance on drafting the will, the legal requirements for its validity, and steps to minimize the risk of legal challenges.Tax Implications: Inheritance tax laws in India may also apply, so it's important to consult with a tax expert to understand any tax obligations associated with inheriting property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They can guide you through the legal process and provide you with the best possible advice.Bail Application: If you or your family members have been arrested, your lawyer can file for bail to secure your release from custody. In many cases, bail can be granted if there's no substantial evidence against you, and the charges appear to be false.Collect Evidence: Work with your lawyer to gather evidence that can prove your innocence. This may include gathering witnesses who can vouch for your whereabouts at the time of the alleged incident, collecting any relevant documents, and obtaining any CCTV footage or other evidence that can support your defense.Challenge the Medical Certificate: If a fake medical certificate has been submitted, your lawyer can challenge its authenticity in court. This may involve obtaining a genuine medical opinion to counter the false certificate.Cross-Examine Witnesses: If the rich person's workers are being presented as witnesses, your lawyer can cross-examine them to expose any inconsistencies or contradictions in their statements.File a Counter Complaint: If you believe that the false charges were filed maliciously, you may consider filing a counter complaint against the individuals who filed the false charges or against the police officers who took bribes, if you have evidence to support such allegations.Seek Legal Remedies Against Police Misconduct: If there is evidence of police misconduct, such as taking bribes or filing false charges, you can pursue legal remedies against the officers involved. This might involve filing a complaint with higher-ranking police officials or approaching the courts to seek appropriate action.Maintain a Record: Keep a detailed record of all interactions related to the case, including conversations with your lawyer, court proceedings, and any evidence collected. This documentation can be crucial in building a strong defense.Attend Court Hearings: Make sure you and your family members attend all court hearings as required. Failure to appear can result in adverse consequences.Stay Informed: Stay informed about the progress of your case and follow the advice of your lawyer closely. Legal procedures in India can be complex, so it's essential to rely on professional guidance.IPC Section 323: Punishment for Voluntarily Causing HurtThis section deals with cases where a person voluntarily causes hurt to another.

If the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to burn or destroy any property, or to accuse any person of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or to impute unchastity to a woman, then the punishment may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.According to Section 34 of theIndian Penal Code, when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.Based on this information, it seems that you are charged with causing hurt and intimidation to the complainant along with four other members of your family who had a common intention to do so. However, you can defend yourself against these charges by proving that they are false and fabricated by the complainant and the cops who took bribe from him.

    "answer": "You may need to take some steps to rectify the error in the name of the seller on the allotment letter and the builder buyer agreement. Some of the steps are:For the builder buyer agreement, which is registered, you can go for a rectification deed, as you have mentioned. A rectification deed is a legal document that allows you to correct any mistakes or errors in the original deed, such as spelling mistakes or typographical errors. A rectification deed must be executed by both parties and registered with the same sub-registrar where the original deed was registered. You may also have to pay a nominal stamp duty and registration fee for the rectification deed.For the allotment letter, which is not registered, you can request the builder to issue a revised allotment letter with the correct name of the seller. You may have to submit an application along with a copy of the original allotment letter and proof of identity of the seller. The builder may charge a nominal fee for issuing a revised allotment letter. Alternatively, you can also take a dual name affidavit from the seller, as someone suggested. A dual name affidavit is a sworn statement that confirms that two different names belong to one and the same person. The seller can execute a dual name affidavit before a notary public or a magistrate, stating that his name is Amandeep Sharma and he is also known as Amandeep Singh. He can also mention the reason for the difference in name and attach copies of his identity proofs, such as PAN card, Aadhar card, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Lalit and P.S. Narasimha observed that courts would be entitled to take cognizance of a complaint or initiation of proceedings even after the prescribed period of limitation lapses.“It is … clear that though Section 468 of the Code mandates that ‘cognizance’ ought to be taken within the specified period from the commission of offence, by invoking the principles of purposive construction, this Court ruled that a complainant should not be put to prejudice, if for reasons beyond the control of the prosecuting agency or the complainant, the cognizance was taken after the period of limitation. It was observed by the Constitution Bench that if the filing of the complaint or initiation of proceedings was within the prescribed period from the date of commission of an offence, the Court would be entitled to take cognizance even after the prescribed period was over.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "There is no specific time limit for filing a complaint againstdomestic violence, but she must be able to prove that you were in a domestic relationship with the harasser at the time the violence took place.Courts can entertain applications filed under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct even beyond limitation period: Supreme Court.Section 468 of the CrPC envisages the period of limitation for taking cognizance of various offences based on the nature, and specifies one year for offences pertaining todomestic violence.The provisions of the Act contemplate filing of an application under Section 12 to initiate the proceedings before the concerned Magistrate. After hearing both sides and after taking into account the material on record, the Magistrate may pass an appropriate order under Section 12 of the Act. It is only the breach of such order which constitutes an offence as is clear from Section 31 of the Act. Thus, if there be any offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act, the limitation prescribed under Section 468 of the Code will apply from the date of commission of such offence. By the time an application is preferred under Section 12 of the Act, there is no offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act and as such there would never be a starting point for limitation from the date of application under Section 12 of the Act. Such a starting point for limitation would arise only and only after there is a breach of an order passed under Section 12 of the Act.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Wife has filed dv sec 12 case 2 yrs after seperation. Will crpc 468 limit apply, How to fight this?",
    "answer": "The limitation period prescribed under Section 468 of theCode of Criminal Procedureis not applicable for the filing of an application by an aggrieved woman under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. The Supreme Court held as erroneous a judgment of the Madras High Court which held that the Section 12 application ought to be filed within 1 year of the act(s) ofdomestic violence, failing which, such application is not maintainable.The Supreme Court observed that an application under Section 12 of the DV Act cannot be treated as an application with respect to an offence. An offence under the DV Act arises only after the order passed under Section 12 is violated under Section 31 of the Act. A notice issued under Section 12 of the Act cannot be regarded as taking cognizance of the offence. Therefore, the provisions of CrPC relating to limitation are not applicable to such applications.Based on this information, it seems that you cannot rely on Section 468 of CrPC to dismiss your wife’s case on the ground of delay. However, you can still challenge her case on other grounds, such as lack of evidence, false allegations, mala fide intention, etc. You can also try to prove that there was nodomestic violencecommitted by you and that your wife is not entitled to any relief under the DV Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientConsult with a Family Law Attorney in India: It's crucial to consult with a family law attorney in India who can review your divorce decree and advise you on the specifics of your case. They can help you understand whether the divorce decree implies custody with you or if you need to take additional legal steps to clarify custody.Amend the Divorce Decree: If your divorce decree does not explicitly mention child custody, you may need to consider amending it to include custody arrangements. Your attorney can help you file a petition in court to seek clarification or modification of the decree to specify custody arrangements.Obtain a Custody Order: If the court determines that it's in the best interest of the children to remain with you, you can obtain a separate custody order from the court. This order should clearly state that you have legal custody of your children. This may strengthen your case during the visa interview.Gather Supporting Documents: Collect any evidence that demonstrates your role as the primary caregiver and responsible parent for your children. This might include school records, medical records, affidavits from family and friends, and financial documents showing that you are supporting them.Consult an Immigration Attorney in the USA: Before attending your visa stamping appointment, it's advisable to consult with an immigration attorney in the USA. They can provide guidance on how to present your case during the visa interview and address any concerns the consular officer may have regarding child custody.Be Prepared for Questions: During your visa interview, be prepared to answer questions related to your children's custody. Explain your role as the primary caregiver and provide any supporting documents if requested.Consider Rescheduling: If you are unable to gather the necessary documentation or legal clarification regarding child custody before your visa appointment, you may consider rescheduling it until you have everything in order to present a stronger case.Please note that visa application processes can be complex, and the requirements may change over time. Consulting with both an Indian family law attorney and a US immigration attorney will provide you with the best guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Prestige Waterford - Land dispute and builder indemnification",
    "answer": "The worst case scenario in this case could be that the court finds that the sellers have indeed encroached on the lake land or forged the documents, and orders them to vacate the land and demolish the project. This could result in a loss of your investment and legal troubles for you as a buyer.The risk to you as a buyer under such a scenario depends on the terms and conditions of your sale agreement with the sellers and the builder. You may have to check if there is any clause that protects your rights and interests in case of such an eventuality. You may also have to consult a lawyer to understand your legal options and remedies.The indemnity clause that you have mentioned may provide some protection to you, but it may not be sufficient or enforceable in all situations. For example, if the sellers are unable to pay the compensation or if they go bankrupt, you may not be able to recover your money. Also, if the court finds that you were aware of the disputes and still bought the property, you may not be able to claim indemnity. Therefore, it is advisable to seek legal advice before relying on such a clause.Reselling the property may be of concern if the litigations are not concluded, as it may affect the market value and demand for the property. You may also face difficulties in finding buyers who are willing to take the risk of buying a disputed property. Moreover, you may have to disclose the pending litigations to the prospective buyers, as per the law.There are many precedents of similar cases where buyers have suffered due to land disputes and builder defaults. For instance, in 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes in Kochi that were built on a coastal zone in violation of environmental norms. The court also directed the builder to pay Rs 25 lakh each to 140 buyers who had invested in the project. Similarly, in 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the cancellation of registration of Amrapali Group, a real estate company that had failed to deliver flats to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida. The court also directed the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to complete the pending projects and appointed a receiver to manage the affairs of the company.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This could result in a significant delay in your ability to possess and use the property as intended. In the most extreme case, you may lose ownership rights to the property if the court rules against the sellers and finds that the property was obtained fraudulently.Risk to the Buyer:As the buyer, you could face several risks in this scenario:Delayed Possession: You may not be able to take possession of the property as planned due to the ongoing legal disputes.Financial Costs: You may incur legal expenses and costs related to defending your ownership rights or settling disputes.Uncertainty: There could be uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and you may not have clear title to the property until the disputes are resolved.Indemnity Clause:The indemnity clause you mentioned is a protective measure that can offer you some recourse if you face losses due to encumbrances or legal disputes related to the property. However, the effectiveness of the clause depends on the financial strength of the sellers and their ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific terms and conditions of this clause and how it would apply in your situation.Reselling the Property:Reselling the property in the midst of ongoing litigation can be challenging. Potential buyers may be hesitant to purchase a property with unresolved legal issues, and you may not be able to get a fair market price until the disputes are resolved. You should also consider potential legal obligations and liabilities when reselling the property.Precedents:It's possible that there are similar cases where buyers have faced difficulties due to property disputes. However, each case is unique, and outcomes can vary based on the specific facts and legal arguments presented.

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, which applies to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists in India, your mother has the absolute right to dispose of her self-acquired property by a will as she wishes. She does not need the consent or signature of your siblings or their children to make a valid will. However, she must make sure that the will is clear, unambiguous, and free from any undue influence or coercion. She must also sign the will in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign it.If your mother makes a will in your favor, you will inherit all the properties from her after her death. However, you may have to face some legal consequences if your siblings or their children challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They may claim that the will was not made by your mother voluntarily or that she was not of sound mind when she made it. They may also claim that the will was forged or tampered with or that they were not aware of its existence.To avoid such disputes, it is advisable that your mother informs your siblings and their children about her intention to make a will in your favor and explains her reasons for doing so. She may also send them a copy of the will after making it and ask them to acknowledge it. This may reduce the chances of any litigation in the future. Alternatively, she may also consider giving you a gift deed for the properties during her lifetime, which will transfer the ownership to you immediately and irrevocably. However, a gift deed may attract stamp duty and registration charges depending on the state where the properties are located.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property inheritance and wills are primarily governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and property laws specific to the state in which the property is located. Here are some key points to consider:Writing a Will: Your mother has the legal right to write a will and specify how her property should be distributed after her passing. She can choose to leave her property to you or any other beneficiary she wishes.Validity of the Will: To ensure the validity of the will, it should typically be executed in accordance with the law. It's advisable for your mother to consult with a lawyer to draft and execute the will properly. The will should clearly state her intentions, and it may not necessarily require your siblings to sign it.Challenging a Will: While your mother has the right to decide how to distribute her property, there is always the possibility that your siblings could challenge the will in court if they believe it was executed under duress, fraud, or other illegal circumstances. However, the burden of proof typically falls on the challenging party.Rights of Foreign Citizens: Your siblings, as U.S. citizens, can inherit property in India. However, they should be aware of Indian laws regarding property ownership by foreign citizens. It's important to consult with an Indian lawyer who can provide advice on the legal requirements and implications for foreign citizens inheriting Indian property.Legal Consultation: To navigate this situation successfully, it is strongly recommended that you and your mother consult with a qualified Indian lawyer who specializes in property law and succession planning. They can provide guidance on drafting the will, the legal requirements for its validity, and steps to minimize the risk of legal challenges.Tax Implications: Inheritance tax laws in India may also apply, so it's important to consult with a tax expert to understand any tax obligations associated with inheriting property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They can guide you through the legal process and provide you with the best possible advice.Bail Application: If you or your family members have been arrested, your lawyer can file for bail to secure your release from custody.

This may include gathering witnesses who can vouch for your whereabouts at the time of the alleged incident, collecting any relevant documents, and obtaining any CCTV footage or other evidence that can support your defense.Challenge the Medical Certificate: If a fake medical certificate has been submitted, your lawyer can challenge its authenticity in court. This may involve obtaining a genuine medical opinion to counter the false certificate.Cross-Examine Witnesses: If the rich person's workers are being presented as witnesses, your lawyer can cross-examine them to expose any inconsistencies or contradictions in their statements.File a Counter Complaint: If you believe that the false charges were filed maliciously, you may consider filing a counter complaint against the individuals who filed the false charges or against the police officers who took bribes, if you have evidence to support such allegations.Seek Legal Remedies Against Police Misconduct: If there is evidence of police misconduct, such as taking bribes or filing false charges, you can pursue legal remedies against the officers involved. This might involve filing a complaint with higher-ranking police officials or approaching the courts to seek appropriate action.Maintain a Record: Keep a detailed record of all interactions related to the case, including conversations with your lawyer, court proceedings, and any evidence collected. This documentation can be crucial in building a strong defense.Attend Court Hearings: Make sure you and your family members attend all court hearings as required.

If the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to burn or destroy any property, or to accuse any person of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or to impute unchastity to a woman, then the punishment may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.According to Section 34 of theIndian Penal Code, when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.Based on this information, it seems that you are charged with causing hurt and intimidation to the complainant along with four other members of your family who had a common intention to do so. However, you can defend yourself against these charges by proving that they are false and fabricated by the complainant and the cops who took bribe from him.

After hearing both sides and after taking into account the material on record, the Magistrate may pass an appropriate order under Section 12 of the Act. It is only the breach of such order which constitutes an offence as is clear from Section 31 of the Act. Thus, if there be any offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act, the limitation prescribed under Section 468 of the Code will apply from the date of commission of such offence. By the time an application is preferred under Section 12 of the Act, there is no offence committed in terms of the provisions of the Act and as such there would never be a starting point for limitation from the date of application under Section 12 of the Act. Such a starting point for limitation would arise only and only after there is a breach of an order passed under Section 12 of the Act.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The limitation period prescribed under Section 468 of theCode of Criminal Procedureis not applicable for the filing of an application by an aggrieved woman under Section 12 of the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. The Supreme Court held as erroneous a judgment of the Madras High Court which held that the Section 12 application ought to be filed within 1 year of the act(s) ofdomestic violence, failing which, such application is not maintainable.The Supreme Court observed that an application under Section 12 of the DV Act cannot be treated as an application with respect to an offence. An offence under the DV Act arises only after the order passed under Section 12 is violated under Section 31 of the Act. A notice issued under Section 12 of the Act cannot be regarded as taking cognizance of the offence. Therefore, the provisions of CrPC relating to limitation are not applicable to such applications.Based on this information, it seems that you cannot rely on Section 468 of CrPC to dismiss your wife’s case on the ground of delay. However, you can still challenge her case on other grounds, such as lack of evidence, false allegations, mala fide intention, etc. You can also try to prove that there was nodomestic violencecommitted by you and that your wife is not entitled to any relief under the DV Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The worst case scenario in this case could be that the court finds that the sellers have indeed encroached on the lake land or forged the documents, and orders them to vacate the land and demolish the project. This could result in a loss of your investment and legal troubles for you as a buyer.The risk to you as a buyer under such a scenario depends on the terms and conditions of your sale agreement with the sellers and the builder. You may have to check if there is any clause that protects your rights and interests in case of such an eventuality. You may also have to consult a lawyer to understand your legal options and remedies.The indemnity clause that you have mentioned may provide some protection to you, but it may not be sufficient or enforceable in all situations. For example, if the sellers are unable to pay the compensation or if they go bankrupt, you may not be able to recover your money. Also, if the court finds that you were aware of the disputes and still bought the property, you may not be able to claim indemnity. Therefore, it is advisable to seek legal advice before relying on such a clause.Reselling the property may be of concern if the litigations are not concluded, as it may affect the market value and demand for the property. You may also face difficulties in finding buyers who are willing to take the risk of buying a disputed property. Moreover, you may have to disclose the pending litigations to the prospective buyers, as per the law.There are many precedents of similar cases where buyers have suffered due to land disputes and builder defaults. For instance, in 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes in Kochi that were built on a coastal zone in violation of environmental norms. The court also directed the builder to pay Rs 25 lakh each to 140 buyers who had invested in the project. Similarly, in 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the cancellation of registration of Amrapali Group, a real estate company that had failed to deliver flats to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida. The court also directed the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to complete the pending projects and appointed a receiver to manage the affairs of the company.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This could result in a significant delay in your ability to possess and use the property as intended. In the most extreme case, you may lose ownership rights to the property if the court rules against the sellers and finds that the property was obtained fraudulently.Risk to the Buyer:As the buyer, you could face several risks in this scenario:Delayed Possession: You may not be able to take possession of the property as planned due to the ongoing legal disputes.Financial Costs: You may incur legal expenses and costs related to defending your ownership rights or settling disputes.Uncertainty: There could be uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and you may not have clear title to the property until the disputes are resolved.Indemnity Clause:The indemnity clause you mentioned is a protective measure that can offer you some recourse if you face losses due to encumbrances or legal disputes related to the property. However, the effectiveness of the clause depends on the financial strength of the sellers and their ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific terms and conditions of this clause and how it would apply in your situation.Reselling the Property:Reselling the property in the midst of ongoing litigation can be challenging. Potential buyers may be hesitant to purchase a property with unresolved legal issues, and you may not be able to get a fair market price until the disputes are resolved. You should also consider potential legal obligations and liabilities when reselling the property.Precedents:It's possible that there are similar cases where buyers have faced difficulties due to property disputes. However, each case is unique, and outcomes can vary based on the specific facts and legal arguments presented.

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, which applies to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists in India, your mother has the absolute right to dispose of her self-acquired property by a will as she wishes. She does not need the consent or signature of your siblings or their children to make a valid will. However, she must make sure that the will is clear, unambiguous, and free from any undue influence or coercion. She must also sign the will in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign it.If your mother makes a will in your favor, you will inherit all the properties from her after her death. However, you may have to face some legal consequences if your siblings or their children challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They may claim that the will was not made by your mother voluntarily or that she was not of sound mind when she made it. They may also claim that the will was forged or tampered with or that they were not aware of its existence.To avoid such disputes, it is advisable that your mother informs your siblings and their children about her intention to make a will in your favor and explains her reasons for doing so. She may also send them a copy of the will after making it and ask them to acknowledge it. This may reduce the chances of any litigation in the future. Alternatively, she may also consider giving you a gift deed for the properties during her lifetime, which will transfer the ownership to you immediately and irrevocably. However, a gift deed may attract stamp duty and registration charges depending on the state where the properties are located.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property inheritance and wills are primarily governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and property laws specific to the state in which the property is located. Here are some key points to consider:Writing a Will: Your mother has the legal right to write a will and specify how her property should be distributed after her passing. She can choose to leave her property to you or any other beneficiary she wishes.Validity of the Will: To ensure the validity of the will, it should typically be executed in accordance with the law. It's advisable for your mother to consult with a lawyer to draft and execute the will properly. The will should clearly state her intentions, and it may not necessarily require your siblings to sign it.Challenging a Will: While your mother has the right to decide how to distribute her property, there is always the possibility that your siblings could challenge the will in court if they believe it was executed under duress, fraud, or other illegal circumstances. However, the burden of proof typically falls on the challenging party.Rights of Foreign Citizens: Your siblings, as U.S. citizens, can inherit property in India. However, they should be aware of Indian laws regarding property ownership by foreign citizens. It's important to consult with an Indian lawyer who can provide advice on the legal requirements and implications for foreign citizens inheriting Indian property.Legal Consultation: To navigate this situation successfully, it is strongly recommended that you and your mother consult with a qualified Indian lawyer who specializes in property law and succession planning. They can provide guidance on drafting the will, the legal requirements for its validity, and steps to minimize the risk of legal challenges.Tax Implications: Inheritance tax laws in India may also apply, so it's important to consult with a tax expert to understand any tax obligations associated with inheriting property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding Child custody question post divorce is issued",
    "answer": "Dear ClientConsult with a Family Law Attorney in India: It's crucial to consult with a family law attorney in India who can review your divorce decree and advise you on the specifics of your case. They can help you understand whether the divorce decree implies custody with you or if you need to take additional legal steps to clarify custody.Amend the Divorce Decree: If your divorce decree does not explicitly mention child custody, you may need to consider amending it to include custody arrangements. Your attorney can help you file a petition in court to seek clarification or modification of the decree to specify custody arrangements.Obtain a Custody Order: If the court determines that it's in the best interest of the children to remain with you, you can obtain a separate custody order from the court. This order should clearly state that you have legal custody of your children. This may strengthen your case during the visa interview.Gather Supporting Documents: Collect any evidence that demonstrates your role as the primary caregiver and responsible parent for your children. This might include school records, medical records, affidavits from family and friends, and financial documents showing that you are supporting them.Consult an Immigration Attorney in the USA: Before attending your visa stamping appointment, it's advisable to consult with an immigration attorney in the USA. They can provide guidance on how to present your case during the visa interview and address any concerns the consular officer may have regarding child custody.Be Prepared for Questions: During your visa interview, be prepared to answer questions related to your children's custody. Explain your role as the primary caregiver and provide any supporting documents if requested.Consider Rescheduling: If you are unable to gather the necessary documentation or legal clarification regarding child custody before your visa appointment, you may consider rescheduling it until you have everything in order to present a stronger case.Please note that visa application processes can be complex, and the requirements may change over time. Consulting with both an Indian family law attorney and a US immigration attorney will provide you with the best guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Prestige Waterford - Land dispute and builder indemnification",
    "answer": "The worst case scenario in this case could be that the court finds that the sellers have indeed encroached on the lake land or forged the documents, and orders them to vacate the land and demolish the project. This could result in a loss of your investment and legal troubles for you as a buyer.The risk to you as a buyer under such a scenario depends on the terms and conditions of your sale agreement with the sellers and the builder. You may have to check if there is any clause that protects your rights and interests in case of such an eventuality. You may also have to consult a lawyer to understand your legal options and remedies.The indemnity clause that you have mentioned may provide some protection to you, but it may not be sufficient or enforceable in all situations. For example, if the sellers are unable to pay the compensation or if they go bankrupt, you may not be able to recover your money. Also, if the court finds that you were aware of the disputes and still bought the property, you may not be able to claim indemnity. Therefore, it is advisable to seek legal advice before relying on such a clause.Reselling the property may be of concern if the litigations are not concluded, as it may affect the market value and demand for the property. You may also face difficulties in finding buyers who are willing to take the risk of buying a disputed property. Moreover, you may have to disclose the pending litigations to the prospective buyers, as per the law.There are many precedents of similar cases where buyers have suffered due to land disputes and builder defaults. For instance, in 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes in Kochi that were built on a coastal zone in violation of environmental norms. The court also directed the builder to pay Rs 25 lakh each to 140 buyers who had invested in the project. Similarly, in 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the cancellation of registration of Amrapali Group, a real estate company that had failed to deliver flats to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida. The court also directed the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to complete the pending projects and appointed a receiver to manage the affairs of the company.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientWorst Case Scenario:The worst-case scenario in this case would likely involve a protracted legal battle with ongoing litigation surrounding the property. This could result in a significant delay in your ability to possess and use the property as intended. In the most extreme case, you may lose ownership rights to the property if the court rules against the sellers and finds that the property was obtained fraudulently.Risk to the Buyer:As the buyer, you could face several risks in this scenario:Delayed Possession: You may not be able to take possession of the property as planned due to the ongoing legal disputes.Financial Costs: You may incur legal expenses and costs related to defending your ownership rights or settling disputes.Uncertainty: There could be uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the litigation, and you may not have clear title to the property until the disputes are resolved.Indemnity Clause:The indemnity clause you mentioned is a protective measure that can offer you some recourse if you face losses due to encumbrances or legal disputes related to the property. However, the effectiveness of the clause depends on the financial strength of the sellers and their ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific terms and conditions of this clause and how it would apply in your situation.Reselling the Property:Reselling the property in the midst of ongoing litigation can be challenging. Potential buyers may be hesitant to purchase a property with unresolved legal issues, and you may not be able to get a fair market price until the disputes are resolved. You should also consider potential legal obligations and liabilities when reselling the property.Precedents:It's possible that there are similar cases where buyers have faced difficulties due to property disputes. However, each case is unique, and outcomes can vary based on the specific facts and legal arguments presented. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law in India can provide you with more information on any relevant precedents and how they might apply to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sibling and children rights on property",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property inheritance and wills are primarily governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and property laws specific to the state in which the property is located. Here are some key points to consider:Writing a Will: Your mother has the legal right to write a will and specify how her property should be distributed after her passing. She can choose to leave her property to you or any other beneficiary she wishes.Validity of the Will: To ensure the validity of the will, it should typically be executed in accordance with the law. It's advisable for your mother to consult with a lawyer to draft and execute the will properly. The will should clearly state her intentions, and it may not necessarily require your siblings to sign it.Challenging a Will: While your mother has the right to decide how to distribute her property, there is always the possibility that your siblings could challenge the will in court if they believe it was executed under duress, fraud, or other illegal circumstances. However, the burden of proof typically falls on the challenging party.Rights of Foreign Citizens: Your siblings, as U.S. citizens, can inherit property in India. However, they should be aware of Indian laws regarding property ownership by foreign citizens. It's important to consult with an Indian lawyer who can provide advice on the legal requirements and implications for foreign citizens inheriting Indian property.Legal Consultation: To navigate this situation successfully, it is strongly recommended that you and your mother consult with a qualified Indian lawyer who specializes in property law and succession planning. They can provide guidance on drafting the will, the legal requirements for its validity, and steps to minimize the risk of legal challenges.Tax Implications: Inheritance tax laws in India may also apply, so it's important to consult with a tax expert to understand any tax obligations associated with inheriting property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Some of the steps are:For the builder buyer agreement, which is registered, you can go for a rectification deed, as you have mentioned. A rectification deed is a legal document that allows you to correct any mistakes or errors in the original deed, such as spelling mistakes or typographical errors. A rectification deed must be executed by both parties and registered with the same sub-registrar where the original deed was registered. You may also have to pay a nominal stamp duty and registration fee for the rectification deed.For the allotment letter, which is not registered, you can request the builder to issue a revised allotment letter with the correct name of the seller. You may have to submit an application along with a copy of the original allotment letter and proof of identity of the seller. The builder may charge a nominal fee for issuing a revised allotment letter. Alternatively, you can also take a dual name affidavit from the seller, as someone suggested. A dual name affidavit is a sworn statement that confirms that two different names belong to one and the same person. The seller can execute a dual name affidavit before a notary public or a magistrate, stating that his name is Amandeep Sharma and he is also known as Amandeep Singh.

Your attorney can help you file a petition in court to seek clarification or modification of the decree to specify custody arrangements.Obtain a Custody Order: If the court determines that it's in the best interest of the children to remain with you, you can obtain a separate custody order from the court. This order should clearly state that you have legal custody of your children. This may strengthen your case during the visa interview.Gather Supporting Documents: Collect any evidence that demonstrates your role as the primary caregiver and responsible parent for your children. This might include school records, medical records, affidavits from family and friends, and financial documents showing that you are supporting them.Consult an Immigration Attorney in the USA: Before attending your visa stamping appointment, it's advisable to consult with an immigration attorney in the USA. They can provide guidance on how to present your case during the visa interview and address any concerns the consular officer may have regarding child custody.Be Prepared for Questions: During your visa interview, be prepared to answer questions related to your children's custody. Explain your role as the primary caregiver and provide any supporting documents if requested.Consider Rescheduling: If you are unable to gather the necessary documentation or legal clarification regarding child custody before your visa appointment, you may consider rescheduling it until you have everything in order to present a stronger case.Please note that visa application processes can be complex, and the requirements may change over time.

RERA primarily focuses on issues such as project registration, builder obligations, and the rights of buyers.Contesting the AOA Decision:Whether you can legally contest the AOA's decision depends on the specific bylaws and regulations of your Apartment Owners Association. Typically, AOA bylaws govern the membership criteria and the conduct of members, including participation in WhatsApp or Google groups.Here are some steps you can consider:a. Review AOA Bylaws: Carefully review the AOA's bylaws, rules, and regulations. If they do not contain any provisions regarding membership in WhatsApp or Google groups, this may strengthen your case for contesting the decision.b. Seek Legal Advice: Consult with a lawyer experienced in property and association law. They can provide legal advice specific to your situation and help you understand whether the AOA's decision is in compliance with the existing bylaws and any applicable laws.c. Mediation or Negotiation: Attempt to resolve the issue through mediation or negotiation with the AOA. Sometimes, disputes can be resolved amicably without resorting to legal action.d. File a Legal Complaint: If it is determined that the AOA's decision is in violation of its own bylaws or applicable laws, you may consider taking legal action to challenge the decision. Your lawyer can guide you through the process of filing a complaint or seeking a legal remedy.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You may need to take some steps to rectify the error in the name of the seller on the allotment letter and the builder buyer agreement. Some of the steps are:For the builder buyer agreement, which is registered, you can go for a rectification deed, as you have mentioned. A rectification deed is a legal document that allows you to correct any mistakes or errors in the original deed, such as spelling mistakes or typographical errors. A rectification deed must be executed by both parties and registered with the same sub-registrar where the original deed was registered. You may also have to pay a nominal stamp duty and registration fee for the rectification deed.For the allotment letter, which is not registered, you can request the builder to issue a revised allotment letter with the correct name of the seller. You may have to submit an application along with a copy of the original allotment letter and proof of identity of the seller. The builder may charge a nominal fee for issuing a revised allotment letter. Alternatively, you can also take a dual name affidavit from the seller, as someone suggested. A dual name affidavit is a sworn statement that confirms that two different names belong to one and the same person. The seller can execute a dual name affidavit before a notary public or a magistrate, stating that his name is Amandeep Sharma and he is also known as Amandeep Singh.

    "question": "Restitution of conjugal rights and its financial implications",
    "answer": "Dear ClientAttachment of Property and Income: In the event of aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) decree, the court can order the attachment of property, income, or bank accounts of the party against whom the decree is issued. The extent of attachment can vary, and it depends on the court's decision based on factors such as your income, expenses, and the needs of the other party. Attachment typically lasts for the duration of the court proceedings, but it can be extended for special reasons.Maintenance from You: Your husband can seek maintenance from you if you are living separately. The amount of maintenance is determined by the court and is based on factors such as your husband's income, your income, and the needs and expenses of both parties. The court will consider the circumstances and merits of the case before making a decision.Child Alimony: Child custody and child support are separate issues from maintenance. The court will decide on child custody and the amount of child support based on the best interests of the child. The amount of child support can vary depending on factors such as the child's needs, your and your boyfriend's incomes, and other relevant circumstances.Repayment of Wedding Expenses: Whether your father-in-law can seek repayment of wedding expenses would depend on the specific circumstances and any agreements that were made at the time of the wedding. It's possible that if there was a specific understanding or agreement regarding repayment of wedding expenses, it could be pursued legally. However, this would be a matter for legal examination and may require evidence of such an agreement.Financially, the decision to marry or not should be based on your individual circumstances, including your relationship with your boyfriend and his family, your own financial situation, and your future plans.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientConsult with a Family Law Attorney in India: It's crucial to consult with a family law attorney in India who can review your divorce decree and advise you on the specifics of your case. They can help you understand whether the divorce decree implies custody with you or if you need to take additional legal steps to clarify custody.Amend the Divorce Decree: If your divorce decree does not explicitly mention child custody, you may need to consider amending it to include custody arrangements. Your attorney can help you file a petition in court to seek clarification or modification of the decree to specify custody arrangements.Obtain a Custody Order: If the court determines that it's in the best interest of the children to remain with you, you can obtain a separate custody order from the court. This order should clearly state that you have legal custody of your children. This may strengthen your case during the visa interview.Gather Supporting Documents: Collect any evidence that demonstrates your role as the primary caregiver and responsible parent for your children. This might include school records, medical records, affidavits from family and friends, and financial documents showing that you are supporting them.Consult an Immigration Attorney in the USA: Before attending your visa stamping appointment, it's advisable to consult with an immigration attorney in the USA. They can provide guidance on how to present your case during the visa interview and address any concerns the consular officer may have regarding child custody.Be Prepared for Questions: During your visa interview, be prepared to answer questions related to your children's custody. Explain your role as the primary caregiver and provide any supporting documents if requested.Consider Rescheduling: If you are unable to gather the necessary documentation or legal clarification regarding child custody before your visa appointment, you may consider rescheduling it until you have everything in order to present a stronger case.Please note that visa application processes can be complex, and the requirements may change over time. Consulting with both an Indian family law attorney and a US immigration attorney will provide you with the best guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRegarding RERA Guidelines:The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) primarily deals with the regulation of the real estate sector in India and the rights of homebuyers. It may not directly address the issue of whether a Power of Attorney (POA) holder can be a member of an Apartment Owners Association (AOA) WhatsApp or Google group. RERA primarily focuses on issues such as project registration, builder obligations, and the rights of buyers.Contesting the AOA Decision:Whether you can legally contest the AOA's decision depends on the specific bylaws and regulations of your Apartment Owners Association. Typically, AOA bylaws govern the membership criteria and the conduct of members, including participation in WhatsApp or Google groups.Here are some steps you can consider:a. Review AOA Bylaws: Carefully review the AOA's bylaws, rules, and regulations. If they do not contain any provisions regarding membership in WhatsApp or Google groups, this may strengthen your case for contesting the decision.b. Seek Legal Advice: Consult with a lawyer experienced in property and association law. They can provide legal advice specific to your situation and help you understand whether the AOA's decision is in compliance with the existing bylaws and any applicable laws.c. Mediation or Negotiation: Attempt to resolve the issue through mediation or negotiation with the AOA. Sometimes, disputes can be resolved amicably without resorting to legal action.d. File a Legal Complaint: If it is determined that the AOA's decision is in violation of its own bylaws or applicable laws, you may consider taking legal action to challenge the decision. Your lawyer can guide you through the process of filing a complaint or seeking a legal remedy.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You may need to take some steps to rectify the error in the name of the seller on the allotment letter and the builder buyer agreement. Some of the steps are:For the builder buyer agreement, which is registered, you can go for a rectification deed, as you have mentioned. A rectification deed is a legal document that allows you to correct any mistakes or errors in the original deed, such as spelling mistakes or typographical errors. A rectification deed must be executed by both parties and registered with the same sub-registrar where the original deed was registered. You may also have to pay a nominal stamp duty and registration fee for the rectification deed.For the allotment letter, which is not registered, you can request the builder to issue a revised allotment letter with the correct name of the seller. You may have to submit an application along with a copy of the original allotment letter and proof of identity of the seller. The builder may charge a nominal fee for issuing a revised allotment letter. Alternatively, you can also take a dual name affidavit from the seller, as someone suggested. A dual name affidavit is a sworn statement that confirms that two different names belong to one and the same person. The seller can execute a dual name affidavit before a notary public or a magistrate, stating that his name is Amandeep Sharma and he is also known as Amandeep Singh. He can also mention the reason for the difference in name and attach copies of his identity proofs, such as PAN card, Aadhar card, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Grounds for quashing may include the absence of any prima facie case, abuse of process, or a case devoid of merit. The court may quash the proceedings if it finds that the case is maliciously filed or an abuse of the legal process.Stay Order:You can also approach the High Court to seek a stay order on the DV case proceedings until the matter is resolved through the quashing petition. The court may grant a stay order if it believes that there are valid reasons to halt the lower court proceedings until the High Court makes a decision on your quashing petition.Defending the Case:Simultaneously, you should engage a skilled lawyer to defend you in the DV case. Your lawyer can present evidence, including the photograph of all four of you at the airport, to establish that you were not present at the alleged time and date of the incident. Your lawyer can also cross-examine witnesses and present other evidence to prove the falsity of the complaint.Mediation:You may consider mediation as an option to resolve the dispute amicably, but this depends on the willingness of both parties to participate.It's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney in India who can review your specific case details and guide you through the legal process.

It thus merits no reiteration that all the High Courts and District Courts must not only pay heed to what has been laid down by the Apex Court in this noteworthy case but also strictly abide by it!

    "answer": "Dear ClientRegarding RERA Guidelines:The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) primarily deals with the regulation of the real estate sector in India and the rights of homebuyers. It may not directly address the issue of whether a Power of Attorney (POA) holder can be a member of an Apartment Owners Association (AOA) WhatsApp or Google group. RERA primarily focuses on issues such as project registration, builder obligations, and the rights of buyers.Contesting the AOA Decision:Whether you can legally contest the AOA's decision depends on the specific bylaws and regulations of your Apartment Owners Association. Typically, AOA bylaws govern the membership criteria and the conduct of members, including participation in WhatsApp or Google groups.Here are some steps you can consider:a. Review AOA Bylaws: Carefully review the AOA's bylaws, rules, and regulations. If they do not contain any provisions regarding membership in WhatsApp or Google groups, this may strengthen your case for contesting the decision.b. Seek Legal Advice: Consult with a lawyer experienced in property and association law. They can provide legal advice specific to your situation and help you understand whether the AOA's decision is in compliance with the existing bylaws and any applicable laws.c. Mediation or Negotiation: Attempt to resolve the issue through mediation or negotiation with the AOA. Sometimes, disputes can be resolved amicably without resorting to legal action.d. File a Legal Complaint: If it is determined that the AOA's decision is in violation of its own bylaws or applicable laws, you may consider taking legal action to challenge the decision. Your lawyer can guide you through the process of filing a complaint or seeking a legal remedy.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The association is responsible for providing services such as maintenance of amenities and enforcing regulations.According to some sources, there is no such rule under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) that POA holder of registered owners cannot be members of AOA WhatsApp and Google group.

    "question": "One of the famous gyms forcing me put biometric otherwise we don't allow you saying is this legal",
    "answer": "In India, biometric and digital personal data are forms of sensitive data requiring heightened levels of protection and consent. Historically, the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (Privacy Rules) governed the collection, storage, and handling of such data. More recently, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act or DPDPA-2023) has come into play.According to both the Privacy Rules and the DPDP Act, any person or entity that collects, receives, possesses, stores, deals, or handles biometric or digital personal data must obtain prior consent from the person providing such data. A comprehensive privacy policy must be disclosed, outlining the purpose of collection, intended usage, retention period, security practices, and grievance redressal mechanisms.Obligations and Rights under the DPDP Act:Data principals (the individuals whose data is being collected) have the right to access, correct, erase, port, and restrict their digital personal data.Data fiduciaries (the entities processing the data) have obligations to classify their data into general, sensitive, and critical categories and abide by varying rules for each.Data fiduciaries are mandated to conduct data protection impact assessments, appoint data protection officers, and conduct periodic audits.They must notify the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the affected data principals in case of a data breach.Data fiduciaries must also adhere to the codes of practice, standards, and regulations issued by the DPA.Explicit consent is required for processing sensitive digital personal data, and additional conditions must be met for cross-border data transfer.For processing critical digital personal data, prior approval from the DPA is mandatory, and a copy of such data must be stored within India.If your gym or any other entity violates these conditions, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority (under the IT Act) or the Data Protection Authority (under the DPDP Act), and you may also seek legal remedies. For further information, you may refer to the DNA Technology Regulation Bill, which pertains to the use of DNA information in particular cases but has sparked some privacy debates, as well as the official website of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for guidelines on the DPDP Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "One of the famous gyms forcing me put biometric otherwise we don't allow you saying is this legal",
    "answer": "Dear ClientReview the Gym Membership Agreement:Carefully review the terms and conditions of your gym membership agreement. This document should outline the rights and responsibilities of both you and the gym. Look for any clauses related to biometric data collection, privacy, and membership requirements.Seek Legal Advice:Consult with a lawyer who specializes in privacy and data protection laws in India. They can provide you with advice on whether the gym's demand for biometric data is in compliance with Indian laws.Check Privacy Laws:India has enacted the Aadhaar Act, which regulates the collection and use of biometric data. Determine whether the gym's actions are in violation of this or other applicable privacy laws.Negotiate with the Gym:Attempt to negotiate with the gym management to find an alternative solution. Explain your concerns and try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that doesn't involve providing biometric data.Raise a Complaint:If negotiations fail and you believe your rights are being violated, you can consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities. In India, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) oversees Aadhaar-related matters, and you can file a complaint with them if necessary.Consider Legal Action:If you believe your rights have been infringed upon, you may choose to take legal action against the gym. Consult with your lawyer to determine the best course of action, which may include filing a lawsuit or seeking an injunction to prevent the gym from enforcing the biometric requirement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Different Name on Allotment letter",
    "answer": "You may need to take some steps to rectify the error in the name of the seller on the allotment letter and the builder buyer agreement. Some of the steps are:For the builder buyer agreement, which is registered, you can go for a rectification deed, as you have mentioned. A rectification deed is a legal document that allows you to correct any mistakes or errors in the original deed, such as spelling mistakes or typographical errors. A rectification deed must be executed by both parties and registered with the same sub-registrar where the original deed was registered. You may also have to pay a nominal stamp duty and registration fee for the rectification deed.For the allotment letter, which is not registered, you can request the builder to issue a revised allotment letter with the correct name of the seller. You may have to submit an application along with a copy of the original allotment letter and proof of identity of the seller. The builder may charge a nominal fee for issuing a revised allotment letter. Alternatively, you can also take a dual name affidavit from the seller, as someone suggested. A dual name affidavit is a sworn statement that confirms that two different names belong to one and the same person. The seller can execute a dual name affidavit before a notary public or a magistrate, stating that his name is Amandeep Sharma and he is also known as Amandeep Singh. He can also mention the reason for the difference in name and attach copies of his identity proofs, such as PAN card, Aadhar card, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientAttachment of Property and Income: In the event of aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) decree, the court can order the attachment of property, income, or bank accounts of the party against whom the decree is issued. The extent of attachment can vary, and it depends on the court's decision based on factors such as your income, expenses, and the needs of the other party. Attachment typically lasts for the duration of the court proceedings, but it can be extended for special reasons.Maintenance from You: Your husband can seek maintenance from you if you are living separately. The amount of maintenance is determined by the court and is based on factors such as your husband's income, your income, and the needs and expenses of both parties. The court will consider the circumstances and merits of the case before making a decision.Child Alimony: Child custody and child support are separate issues from maintenance. The court will decide on child custody and the amount of child support based on the best interests of the child. The amount of child support can vary depending on factors such as the child's needs, your and your boyfriend's incomes, and other relevant circumstances.Repayment of Wedding Expenses: Whether your father-in-law can seek repayment of wedding expenses would depend on the specific circumstances and any agreements that were made at the time of the wedding. It's possible that if there was a specific understanding or agreement regarding repayment of wedding expenses, it could be pursued legally. However, this would be a matter for legal examination and may require evidence of such an agreement.Financially, the decision to marry or not should be based on your individual circumstances, including your relationship with your boyfriend and his family, your own financial situation, and your future plans.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It may not directly address the issue of whether a Power of Attorney (POA) holder can be a member of an Apartment Owners Association (AOA) WhatsApp or Google group. RERA primarily focuses on issues such as project registration, builder obligations, and the rights of buyers.Contesting the AOA Decision:Whether you can legally contest the AOA's decision depends on the specific bylaws and regulations of your Apartment Owners Association. Typically, AOA bylaws govern the membership criteria and the conduct of members, including participation in WhatsApp or Google groups.Here are some steps you can consider:a. Review AOA Bylaws: Carefully review the AOA's bylaws, rules, and regulations. If they do not contain any provisions regarding membership in WhatsApp or Google groups, this may strengthen your case for contesting the decision.b. Seek Legal Advice: Consult with a lawyer experienced in property and association law. They can provide legal advice specific to your situation and help you understand whether the AOA's decision is in compliance with the existing bylaws and any applicable laws.c. Mediation or Negotiation: Attempt to resolve the issue through mediation or negotiation with the AOA. Sometimes, disputes can be resolved amicably without resorting to legal action.d.

If you have already been arrested, you can seek regular bail to secure your release during the trial.Filing for Quashing of FIR/Charges: You can approach the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC) seeking to quash the FIR (First Information Report) or charges against you. For this, you need to show that the charges are false, frivolous, or do not disclose any offense. The presence of evidence, such as work emails, Google Maps timeline, and a bus ticket, can support your claim of innocence.Collecting and Preserving Evidence: Continue collecting and preserving any evidence that supports your alibi or proves the charges against you are false. This may include phone records, witness statements, and any other documentation that can establish your whereabouts and innocence.Hiring a Competent Criminal Defense Lawyer: It's crucial to engage an experienced criminal defense lawyer who can navigate the legal process on your behalf, advise you on the best course of action, and represent you effectively in court.Filing a Counter-Complaint: If you believe that your relative filed a false complaint against you out of malice or with wrongful intent, you can consider filing a counter-complaint against them for filing a false complaint, defamation, or any other applicable offense. Your lawyer can guide you on this matter.Alternative Dispute Resolution: In some cases, mediation or settlement negotiations may be an option to resolve the dispute without going through a protracted legal battle.

    "question": "One of the famous gyms forcing me put biometric otherwise we don't allow you saying is this legal",
    "answer": "In India, biometric and digital personal data are forms of sensitive data requiring heightened levels of protection and consent. Historically, the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (Privacy Rules) governed the collection, storage, and handling of such data. More recently, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act or DPDPA-2023) has come into play.According to both the Privacy Rules and the DPDP Act, any person or entity that collects, receives, possesses, stores, deals, or handles biometric or digital personal data must obtain prior consent from the person providing such data. A comprehensive privacy policy must be disclosed, outlining the purpose of collection, intended usage, retention period, security practices, and grievance redressal mechanisms.Obligations and Rights under the DPDP Act:Data principals (the individuals whose data is being collected) have the right to access, correct, erase, port, and restrict their digital personal data.Data fiduciaries (the entities processing the data) have obligations to classify their data into general, sensitive, and critical categories and abide by varying rules for each.Data fiduciaries are mandated to conduct data protection impact assessments, appoint data protection officers, and conduct periodic audits.They must notify the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the affected data principals in case of a data breach.Data fiduciaries must also adhere to the codes of practice, standards, and regulations issued by the DPA.Explicit consent is required for processing sensitive digital personal data, and additional conditions must be met for cross-border data transfer.For processing critical digital personal data, prior approval from the DPA is mandatory, and a copy of such data must be stored within India.If your gym or any other entity violates these conditions, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority (under the IT Act) or the Data Protection Authority (under the DPDP Act), and you may also seek legal remedies. For further information, you may refer to the DNA Technology Regulation Bill, which pertains to the use of DNA information in particular cases but has sparked some privacy debates, as well as the official website of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for guidelines on the DPDP Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

They can provide you with advice on whether the gym's demand for biometric data is in compliance with Indian laws.Check Privacy Laws:India has enacted the Aadhaar Act, which regulates the collection and use of biometric data. Determine whether the gym's actions are in violation of this or other applicable privacy laws.Negotiate with the Gym:Attempt to negotiate with the gym management to find an alternative solution. Explain your concerns and try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that doesn't involve providing biometric data.Raise a Complaint:If negotiations fail and you believe your rights are being violated, you can consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities. In India, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) oversees Aadhaar-related matters, and you can file a complaint with them if necessary.Consider Legal Action:If you believe your rights have been infringed upon, you may choose to take legal action against the gym. Consult with your lawyer to determine the best course of action, which may include filing a lawsuit or seeking an injunction to prevent the gym from enforcing the biometric requirement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Live-in and child born out of wedlock",
    "answer": "First of all, you have the right to choose whether to marry or not. Live-in relationships are not illegal or immoral in India, and consenting adults have the right to cohabit without marriage. The Supreme Court has held that live-in relationships come within the ambit of Right to Life under Article 21 of theConstitution of India. Therefore, you cannot be forced to marry against your will by anyone, including your parents or boyfriend’s parents. If you feel threatened or harassed by them, you can seek protection from the police or the court.Secondly, you have certain rights as a live-in partner, especially if your relationship fulfills certain conditions laid down by the Supreme Court. These rights include:Right to maintenance under section 125 ofCriminal Procedure Code, 1973. You can claim financial support from your boyfriend if he refuses or neglects to maintain you adequately.Rights given under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. You can seek relief from any form ofdomestic violence, including physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, or economic abuse, by your boyfriend or his family members.Right to property under theHindu Succession Act, 2005. You can claim a share in your boyfriend’s ancestral or self-acquired property if you can prove that you have contributed to it financially or otherwise.Right to visa extension if you are a foreign national living with an Indian citizen. You can apply for a long-term visa based on your live-in relationship.Thirdly, your child has certain rights as well, regardless of whether you marry or not. These rights include:Right to maintenance from both parents under section 125 ofCriminal Procedure Code, 1973. You and your boyfriend are legally bound to provide for your child’s basic needs and education.Right to inheritance from both parents under section 16 ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Your child is considered legitimate and has equal rights as any other child born in a lawful wedlock.Right to father’s name and identity under section 112 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Your child can claim paternity from your boyfriend if there is no evidence to the contrary.These are some of the legal rights that you and your child have in a live-in relationship in India. However, these rights are not absolute and may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Therefore, it is advisable that you consult a lawyer who can guide you better and help you protect your interests.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Wherebyin most cases, it was granted to the women and the children insuch a relationship. However, the amount of maintenance will always depend upon the merits of the case.It signifies that if a female has been in a live-in relationship for a sensible period of time, she ought to have the legitimate privileges as that of a spouse and can claim maintenance under Section125 CrPC.Unlike in some other countries, live-in relationships are not recognized as a legal union under any law in India. However, the Supreme Court of India has held thatliving together as partners without getting married is not illegal or a criminal offense.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

In your case, since you have been in a live-in relationship and have a child together, you may be entitled to certain rights related to child custody, maintenance, and the child's name even without marriage.Child's Rights: The child has the right to maintenance and to carry the name of his father, regardless of whether you and your boyfriend marry or not. Courts generally uphold these rights.Forced Marriage: If you believe you are being forced into marriage against your will, you can approach the police and file a complaint under relevant sections of theIndian Penal Code, such asSection 498A(cruelty by husband or his relatives) or Section 375 (marital rape). Consult with a lawyer for advice on how to proceed with such a complaint.Right to Choose Residence: You have the right to choose where you want to live. No one can force you to live with your boyfriend's family if you do not wish to. After marriage, if you still do not want to live with them, you should discuss the matter with your husband and his family, and if necessary, consult a lawyer to understand your legal options.Maintenance for the Child: If you and your boyfriend do not marry, he is still legally obligated to provide for the child's maintenance. You can file a petition under Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedurefor child maintenance.Legal Action: While your boyfriend's family may not be able to take legal action against you for refusing to marry, they may attempt to initiate proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rights(RCR) after marriage.

    "question": "New business setup paperwork needed with cost",
    "answer": "Dear ClientSetting up a company involves several legal and administrative steps. Here are some legal remedies and considerations for starting your e-commerce business with multiple brands under it:Required Paperwork and Costs:a. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): If you plan to share proprietary information with third-party manufacturers, it's advisable to have them sign an NDA to protect your intellectual property. Legal costs for drafting an NDA can vary but are typically reasonable.b. GST Registration: If your annual turnover is expected to exceed the prescribed threshold (which varies by country), you may need to register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) or its equivalent. The cost for GST registration can vary depending on your location.c. CIN (Company Identification Number): If you choose to register your company as a Private Limited Company or Limited Company, you'll receive a Corporate Identification Number (CIN). The cost of incorporating such companies can vary but is usually higher compared to other business structures.d. Trademark Registration: To protect your brand names and logos, it's advisable to register trademarks. The costs for trademark registration vary based on the number of classes you register under and the region/country in which you seek protection.Choice of Business Structure:You mentioned considering Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or One Person Company (OPC). The choice of business structure should be based on various factors, including your long-term business goals, tax implications, and liability. Here are some points to consider:LLP: Provides limited liability for partners and is relatively easier to set up compared to a Private Limited Company. Tax implications can be favorable, as LLPs are often taxed similarly to partnerships. Annual compliance costs are generally lower compared to companies.OPC: Suitable if you want to operate as a single owner. OPCs also offer limited liability. Tax implications depend on your income and may be similar to those of sole proprietorships or individual taxation.Consult with a chartered accountant (CA) or tax consultant to assess the tax implications based on your specific circumstances.Annual Maintenance Expense:The annual maintenance expenses for a company can vary depending on its structure, size, and compliance requirements. Generally, an LLP has lower annual compliance costs compared to a Private Limited Company. Expect to incur expenses related to accounting, annual filings, audits, and other statutory compliance requirements. Consulting a CA can help estimate these costs more accurately.Choosing a Professional:Chartered Accountant (CA): CAs specialize in taxation, financial planning, and compliance. They can assist with GST registration, tax planning, and financial matters.Corporate Lawyer: Corporate lawyers specialize in legal aspects of business, including drafting contracts, agreements, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They can help with drafting NDAs, shareholder agreements, and other legal documents.Attorney: An attorney can provide legal advice and draft legal documents, but their expertise may vary depending on their specialization.It's often advisable to consult both a CA and a corporate lawyer to cover both financial and legal aspects of your business. They can provide comprehensive guidance on the setup and ongoing compliance requirements of your company.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "One of the famous gyms forcing me put biometric otherwise we don't allow you saying is this legal",
    "answer": "In India, biometric and digital personal data are forms of sensitive data requiring heightened levels of protection and consent. Historically, the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (Privacy Rules) governed the collection, storage, and handling of such data. More recently, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act or DPDPA-2023) has come into play.According to both the Privacy Rules and the DPDP Act, any person or entity that collects, receives, possesses, stores, deals, or handles biometric or digital personal data must obtain prior consent from the person providing such data. A comprehensive privacy policy must be disclosed, outlining the purpose of collection, intended usage, retention period, security practices, and grievance redressal mechanisms.Obligations and Rights under the DPDP Act:Data principals (the individuals whose data is being collected) have the right to access, correct, erase, port, and restrict their digital personal data.Data fiduciaries (the entities processing the data) have obligations to classify their data into general, sensitive, and critical categories and abide by varying rules for each.Data fiduciaries are mandated to conduct data protection impact assessments, appoint data protection officers, and conduct periodic audits.They must notify the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the affected data principals in case of a data breach.Data fiduciaries must also adhere to the codes of practice, standards, and regulations issued by the DPA.Explicit consent is required for processing sensitive digital personal data, and additional conditions must be met for cross-border data transfer.For processing critical digital personal data, prior approval from the DPA is mandatory, and a copy of such data must be stored within India.If your gym or any other entity violates these conditions, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority (under the IT Act) or the Data Protection Authority (under the DPDP Act), and you may also seek legal remedies. For further information, you may refer to the DNA Technology Regulation Bill, which pertains to the use of DNA information in particular cases but has sparked some privacy debates, as well as the official website of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for guidelines on the DPDP Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Since this is your mother's own and absolute property, it is her own decision to allot any share and in any ratio to her children, she cannot be compelled to distribute the property as per your wish or even through court of law.3. Until and unless there is any agreement in writing between you and your mother towards the reported investment, you cannot claim anything in it as a right, however based on the evidence for your investment, you can ask your mother either to allot a share in the property or to return your invested amount, though this may not be legally enforceable.4.

However, the amount of maintenance will always depend upon the merits of the case.It signifies that if a female has been in a live-in relationship for a sensible period of time, she ought to have the legitimate privileges as that of a spouse and can claim maintenance under Section125 CrPC.Unlike in some other countries, live-in relationships are not recognized as a legal union under any law in India. However, the Supreme Court of India has held thatliving together as partners without getting married is not illegal or a criminal offense.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientLive-in Relationship: In India, there is no specific law governing live-in relationships, but they are recognized by the judiciary as valid. In your case, since you have been in a live-in relationship and have a child together, you may be entitled to certain rights related to child custody, maintenance, and the child's name even without marriage.Child's Rights: The child has the right to maintenance and to carry the name of his father, regardless of whether you and your boyfriend marry or not. Courts generally uphold these rights.Forced Marriage: If you believe you are being forced into marriage against your will, you can approach the police and file a complaint under relevant sections of theIndian Penal Code, such asSection 498A(cruelty by husband or his relatives) or Section 375 (marital rape). Consult with a lawyer for advice on how to proceed with such a complaint.Right to Choose Residence: You have the right to choose where you want to live. No one can force you to live with your boyfriend's family if you do not wish to. After marriage, if you still do not want to live with them, you should discuss the matter with your husband and his family, and if necessary, consult a lawyer to understand your legal options.Maintenance for the Child: If you and your boyfriend do not marry, he is still legally obligated to provide for the child's maintenance. You can file a petition under Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedurefor child maintenance.Legal Action: While your boyfriend's family may not be able to take legal action against you for refusing to marry, they may attempt to initiate proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rights(RCR) after marriage. In such cases, it is essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your options and how to protect your rights.Communicating with Your Parents: To explain your concerns to your parents, consider seeking the advice of a family counselor or mediator who can help facilitate a conversation and address everyone's concerns.Legal Counsel: It is highly advisable to consult with a family lawyer who specializes in Indian family law to fully understand your rights, options, and potential consequences of your decisions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The property is reported to have been purchased in the name of your mother hence she will be considered as the absolute owner of the property, therefore legally she can distribute the property in any manner to her children or even can sell the property without the consent of anyone.  Please note thatMuslims do not follow or recognise the joint family system in matters of inheritance, hence even though your father funded for the purchase of the property and you might have invested in the property development, it cannot be treated as benami transaction hence any attempt to get the property through a partition or invoking any provision of law through court, may not fetch you the desired result.2. Since this is your mother's own and absolute property, it is her own decision to allot any share and in any ratio to her children, she cannot be compelled to distribute the property as per your wish or even through court of law.3. Until and unless there is any agreement in writing between you and your mother towards the reported investment, you cannot claim anything in it as a right, however based on the evidence for your investment, you can ask your mother either to allot a share in the property or to return your invested amount, though this may not be legally enforceable.4.

    "question": "How to cancel registered lease deed?",
    "answer": "A registered lease deed is a legal document that creates a contractual relationship between the landlord and the tenant for the use and occupation of a property for a specified period and rent. A registered lease deed can be cancelled by mutual consent of both parties or by operation of law. A registered lease deed can also be challenged in court on various grounds, such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, mistake, lack of free consent, lack of mental capacity, etc.Some of the steps that you can take to cancel a registered lease deed are as follows:Obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the tenant stating that he/she has no objection to the cancellation of the lease deed and that he/she has vacated the premises and surrendered the possession to the landlord. The NOC should also state that the tenant has no claim or right over the property and that he/she releases the landlord from all liabilities and obligations under the lease deed.Execute a cancellation deed with the tenant in the presence of two witnesses. The cancellation deed should mention the details of the lease deed, such as date, parties, property, rent, term, etc. The cancellation deed should also mention the reason and mode of cancellation, such as mutual consent, expiry of term, breach of conditions, etc. The cancellation deed should also mention that both parties have settled all their dues and disputes and that they have no further claims or complaints against each other.Register the cancellation deed with the sub-registrar office where the lease deed was registered. You should pay the applicable stamp duty and registration charges for the cancellation deed. You should also submit copies of the lease deed, NOC, identity proof, address proof, and photographs of both parties along with the cancellation deed.Update your records with the revenue department and other concerned authorities regarding the cancellation of the lease deed. You should also obtain a fresh encumbrance certificate from the sub-registrar office showing that there is no encumbrance on your property due to the lease deed.Now, coming to your questions:Since it is a registered lease deed what should we do, as a buyer, to ensure complete documentation?As a buyer, you should ensure that you have all the necessary documents and approvals for purchasing the property from the seller. You should also verify that the seller has clear title and possession over the property and that there is no dispute or litigation pending over it. You should also check that there is no encumbrance or lien on the property due to any loan, mortgage, tax, etc. You should also inspect the physical condition and location of the property and ensure that it matches with the description and specifications given by the seller.Will a registered cancellation deed be required to cancel the registered lease ?Yes, a registered cancellation deed will be required to cancel the registered lease. A registered cancellation deed will ensure that there is no legal validity or enforceability of the lease deed and that there is no scope for any future claim or dispute by either party.Will a tripartite unregistered agreement between buyer, seller and tenant confirming that the lease has been terminated, possession given back to landlord- seller and that tenant has no tenancy or other right in the premises be sufficient?No, a tripartite unregistered agreement between buyer, seller and tenant will not be sufficient to cancel the registered lease. An unregistered agreement will not have any legal value or effect as compared to a registered document. An unregistered agreement will also not reflect in the official records and may not be accepted by the authorities or courts as evidence. An unregistered agreement may also be challenged or disputed by any party on various grounds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "How to cancel registered lease deed?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientHere are some steps you may consider taking to ensure complete documentation and address the registered lease deed issue:Consult a Property Lawyer: Engage a qualified property lawyer in Gurugram who specializes in real estate transactions. They can review all the documents and advise you on the best course of action.Obtain Tenant's Written Consent: As the seller claims that the lease was for income tax purposes and the property is vacant, it's important to obtain written consent from the tenant stating that they have no tenancy or other rights in the premises, and that possession has been returned to the seller. This can help establish that the lease is no longer in effect.Tripartite Agreement: You may consider drafting a tripartite agreement among the buyer, seller, and tenant. This agreement should confirm the termination of the lease, the return of possession to the seller, and the tenant's acknowledgment that they have no ongoing rights in the property. While this agreement can be used for clarity, it may not override the registered lease deed in case of a dispute, so it's important to get the tenant's cooperation.Registered Cancellation Deed: To provide greater legal certainty, you might want to explore the possibility of executing a registered cancellation deed for the earlier registered lease deed. This would effectively cancel the earlier lease and remove any legal encumbrances on the property. Consult with your lawyer on the specific requirements and process for registering such a deed in Haryana.Title Insurance: Consider obtaining title insurance to protect yourself against any unforeseen title defects or disputes related to the property. Title insurance policies can provide coverage for legal costs and financial losses in case of title-related issues.Due Diligence: Ensure that all other due diligence aspects of the property purchase are completed, such as verifying the seller's title, checking for any other encumbrances or liabilities on the property, and confirming that all necessary approvals and clearances are in place.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Living separately from husband and child",
    "answer": "The answers to your questions are as follows:It is unlikely that your in-laws can issue a mental cruelty case against you for refusing to live with them and taking care of the child. Mental cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, and it refers to the conduct of one spouse that causes mental pain, suffering, or humiliation to the other spouse. Your in-laws are not your spouses, and they cannot claim mental cruelty from you. Moreover, you have not abandoned or neglected your child, but you are willing to take care of him or her living separately from your husband. Therefore, you have not committed any offence that can send you to jail.Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. If your husband files a petition forrestitution of conjugal rightsagainst you and obtains a decree from the court, you will have to comply with it or show a valid reason for your refusal. If you fail to do so, the court may attach your property or income and transfer it to your husband. However, the court cannot send you to jail for contempt of court for not obeying the decree ofrestitution of conjugal rights. The Supreme Court has held that such imprisonment is unconstitutional and violates the right to personal liberty.If your in-laws let you keep the child living separately, the child will not be denied maintenance. Under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, both parents are obligated to maintain their minor children according to their financial capacity. Therefore, your husband will have to pay child maintenance alimony to you or directly to the child, regardless of whether you live in their matrimonial home or not. The amount of child maintenance alimony will depend on various factors, such as the income of both parents, the needs and expenses of the child, and the standard of living of the child before separation. The court will decide the amount after considering all these factors. You cannot be made to pay for the child’s nanny and other expenses if you do not have sufficient income or resources.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

No, RCR will not have effect on your life , as there is not any provision in the law that force wife to live with her husband , and even no contempt made out for the non-compliance of the court order of RCR.3.

    "question": "Living separately from husband and child",
    "answer": "Dear ClientMental Cruelty Case: In India, mental cruelty is a ground for seeking a divorce. If your in-laws file a case of mental cruelty against you, it would typically be a part of divorce proceedings initiated by your husband. Refusing to live with your husband and in-laws while expressing your willingness to take care of the child separately may not necessarily constitute mental cruelty. The court will consider various factors in such cases, and it's important to defend your position with the help of legal counsel.Restitution of Conjugal Rights:Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows one spouse to request the other to return to the marital home. If a court orders therestitution of conjugal rightsand attaches property, it generally means that the court is encouraging reconciliation. Failure to comply with such an order can result in contempt of court proceedings. However, imprisonment is not typically the first remedy, and the court may explore other options before resorting to imprisonment.Child Maintenance: In India, both parents have a legal obligation to provide for the maintenance and well-being of their child. Child maintenance is typically determined based on the financial capacity of the parents and the child's needs. Your husband's income would likely be a significant factor in determining child support. If your husband's family agrees to let you keep the child separately, they should still contribute to the child's maintenance. It's unlikely that they can compel you to live with them to receive maintenance for the child. The court may consider your respective incomes and other relevant factors to determine child support.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Living separately from husband and child",
    "answer": "The answers to your questions are as follows:It is unlikely that your in-laws can issue a mental cruelty case against you for refusing to live with them and taking care of the child. Mental cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, and it refers to the conduct of one spouse that causes mental pain, suffering, or humiliation to the other spouse. Your in-laws are not your spouses, and they cannot claim mental cruelty from you. Moreover, you have not abandoned or neglected your child, but you are willing to take care of him or her living separately from your husband. Therefore, you have not committed any offence that can send you to jail.Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. If your husband files a petition forrestitution of conjugal rightsagainst you and obtains a decree from the court, you will have to comply with it or show a valid reason for your refusal. If you fail to do so, the court may attach your property or income and transfer it to your husband. However, the court cannot send you to jail for contempt of court for not obeying the decree ofrestitution of conjugal rights. The Supreme Court has held that such imprisonment is unconstitutional and violates the right to personal liberty.If your in-laws let you keep the child living separately, the child will not be denied maintenance. Under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, both parents are obligated to maintain their minor children according to their financial capacity. Therefore, your husband will have to pay child maintenance alimony to you or directly to the child, regardless of whether you live in their matrimonial home or not. The amount of child maintenance alimony will depend on various factors, such as the income of both parents, the needs and expenses of the child, and the standard of living of the child before separation. The court will decide the amount after considering all these factors. You cannot be made to pay for the child’s nanny and other expenses if you do not have sufficient income or resources.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. No , they cannot take any legal action on this point , as your husband being the natural guardian is also under obligation to look after the child , and hence even you can refuse the custody of child.- Further , they cannot force you to keep the custody with you on any ground , and even court will see the welfare of the child before giving custody , and as your income is less than husband then you can denied the custody before the court2. No, RCR will not have effect on your life , as there is not any provision in the law that force wife to live with her husband , and even no contempt made out for the non-compliance of the court order of RCR.3. Since, the income of your husband is more than you , then he is under obligation to pay the maintenance to the child with education expenditure.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Living separately from husband and child",
    "answer": "Dear ClientMental Cruelty Case: In India, mental cruelty is a ground for seeking a divorce. If your in-laws file a case of mental cruelty against you, it would typically be a part of divorce proceedings initiated by your husband. Refusing to live with your husband and in-laws while expressing your willingness to take care of the child separately may not necessarily constitute mental cruelty. The court will consider various factors in such cases, and it's important to defend your position with the help of legal counsel.Restitution of Conjugal Rights:Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows one spouse to request the other to return to the marital home. If a court orders therestitution of conjugal rightsand attaches property, it generally means that the court is encouraging reconciliation. Failure to comply with such an order can result in contempt of court proceedings. However, imprisonment is not typically the first remedy, and the court may explore other options before resorting to imprisonment.Child Maintenance: In India, both parents have a legal obligation to provide for the maintenance and well-being of their child. Child maintenance is typically determined based on the financial capacity of the parents and the child's needs. Your husband's income would likely be a significant factor in determining child support. If your husband's family agrees to let you keep the child separately, they should still contribute to the child's maintenance. It's unlikely that they can compel you to live with them to receive maintenance for the child. The court may consider your respective incomes and other relevant factors to determine child support.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Release Deed, Property in Bangalore, Karnataka",
    "answer": "To accomplish your wish of releasing your share or rights in your father’s property in Bangalore, Karnataka, you will need to execute a release deed in favour of your surviving brother or the wife of your deceased brother or both. A release deed is a legal document that transfers your interest or claim in a property to another person without any monetary consideration. A release deed can be executed by any person who has a right or share in a property, either by inheritance, gift, or will.Some of the documentations required for executing a release deed are:The original title deed of the propertyThe will of your fatherThe death certificates of your father, mother, and deceased brotherThe identity proofs and address proofs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe passport size photographs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe stamp paper of appropriate value as per the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957The registration fee as per the Karnataka Registration Rules, 1965You do not need the consent of all your siblings to execute a release deed, as long as you are releasing only your share or rights in the property. However, it is advisable to inform them about your decision and obtain their no objection certificates (NOCs) to avoid any future disputes or challenges to the release deed.Your presence in India is not a must for executing a release deed. You can accomplish this through a power of attorney (POA) given to a trusted person in India who can act on your behalf. However, you will need to follow certain steps to make a valid POA from abroad. These steps are:Draft a POA document on a plain paper with all the details and terms of the authority given to your agent in India.Sign the POA document and get it attested by a notary public or the Indian consulate or embassy in your country of residence.Send the attested POA document to your agent in India by courier or registered post.Ask your agent to get the POA document stamped/adjudicated and registered in India within three months of receiving it.Ask your agent to use the POA document to execute the release deed on your behalfThe process of executing a release deed through a POA may take around one to two months, depending on various factors such as the availability of documents, the stamp duty and registration charges, the verification process, etc. The approximate cost of executing a release deed through a POA may vary from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000, depending on the value of the property, the stamp duty and registration fee applicable in Karnataka, the notary and courier charges, etc.Some other things that you should be aware of are:A release deed is irrevocable and cannot be cancelled once executed.A release deed should be clear and unambiguous and should mention the names, addresses, and relationships of all the parties involved.A release deed should be witnessed by at least two independent witnesses who are not related to any of the parties involved.A release deed should be registered with the sub-registrar’s office within whose jurisdiction the property is situated.A release deed should be executed within 12 years from the date of death of your father or from the date when you became aware of your right or share in the propertyMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Abandonment of child leaving husband’s home under Section 317 IPC and Section 75",
    "answer": "You cannot be sued under IPC section 317 or section 75 for abandonment of the child, if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the baby in his care. Section 317 of theIndian Penal Codestates that anyone who is the parent or caretaker of a child under twelve years and intentionally leaves the child in a place with the intention of completely abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years, or a fine, or both. Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 states that anyone who leaves a child in any place with the intention of abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to three years, or a fine of one lakh rupees, or both.However, in your case, you are not leaving the child in any place, but in the care of your husband, who is also the child’s father and natural guardian. Therefore, you are not abandoning the child, but merely giving up your custody rights. You are also willing to take care of the child and live separately from your husband, which shows that you are not neglecting or deserting the child. Therefore, you cannot be charged under these sections for abandonment of the child.However, this does not mean that you will not face any legal repercussions if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the child with him. Some of the possible legal consequences are:Your husband may file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or desertion by you under Section 13(1)(ia) or (ib) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. He may also claim alimony or maintenance from you under Section 25 of the same act.Your husband may file for sole custody or guardianship of the child under Section 6 or 7 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. He may also claim child support or maintenance from you under Section 20 of the same act.You may lose your parental rights and responsibilities towards the child, such as your right to visitation, access, education, health, religion, etc. You may also lose your inheritance rights over the child’s property.You may face social stigma and discrimination from your family and society for leaving your husband and child.Therefore, it is advisable that you do not take such a drastic step without considering all the legal and personal implications. You should try to resolve your marital issues amicably with your husband and seek professional help if needed. You should also think about the best interests and welfare of your child and how your decision will affect him or her. You should consult a lawyer for specific guidance on your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Abandonment of child leaving husband’s home under Section 317 IPC and Section 75",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn many legal systems, parents have certain rights and responsibilities towards their children, regardless of whether they are living together or separately. If you decide to live separately from your husband and want to take care of your child, you typically have the following options:Negotiate a Custody Agreement: You and your husband can come to an agreement on child custody and visitation arrangements, either informally or through mediation. This can help establish clear guidelines on how the child's time will be divided between both parents.Legal Custody: Legal custody refers to the right to make important decisions about the child's upbringing, such as education and healthcare. In many cases, both parents continue to share legal custody even if they don't live together.Physical Custody: Physical custody refers to where the child resides. If you have physical custody, the child will primarily live with you, but your husband may still have visitation rights or parenting time.Child Support: If your husband is not the primary caregiver, he may be required to pay child support to help with the child's expenses, even if he has visitation rights.It's important to note that unless there are concerns about the child's safety or well-being, most legal systems prioritize the best interests of the child. Courts generally aim to ensure that both parents have a role in the child's life.Abandonment charges are typically not applicable if you are leaving the child with the other parent, especially if it's agreed upon by both parties. However, you should consult with an attorney in your jurisdiction to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation. They can help you navigate the legal process and protect your rights as well as the best interests of the child.In situations like this, it's often advisable to seek legal counsel early to ensure that your rights as a parent are protected and that any arrangements are made in a legally enforceable manner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is not understood that on what basis you have been advised for re-allotment by DDA .Where is the question of re-allotment because the original allottee is not alive and his legal heir has already sold the property by a registered sale deed in favor of a buyer and that buyer is now selling this property to you.So how can DDA re-allot the property in your favor or in favor of your vendor?Don't fall prey to such non maintainable advises.The problem here is that the legal heirs have executed an unregistered relinquishment deed, hence the title to the seller is defective.Your vendor did not bother about the legality of the issue while he purchased the property hence his title is also defective due to the said reason.Now it is seen that it will not be possible for your vendor to gather all the legal heirs and get a ratification deed relinquishing their rights by a registered document.Hence it is advisable that you keep away from this property, demand the vendor to return the booking amount with interest because he failed to produce the valid and substantial documents pertaining to the property.Indemnity bond will not hold in the event of any dispute and the bank also will not grant loan on the basis of the indemnity bondT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientCompromise Decree: The compromise decree issued by the Bangalore magistrate court in 2001 is a legally binding document. It specified that D agreed to accept 4 lakhs in cash instead of the 8 lakhs initially sought. The court also ordered the land to be registered within 15 days.Non-Registration of Land: Since the land was not registered as per the court order within 15 days, there may be issues related to the compliance with the court's decree.Subdivision and Sale: The subdivision of the land into multiple plots and the subsequent sale of those plots to various individuals, including Party E, could potentially raise legal issues. The sale deeds mentioning the case number from the lawsuit may indicate that there is a legal dispute associated with the land.Property Taxes: Party E has been paying property taxes since 2001. This may establish their possession or claim to the property, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal complexities arising from the compromise decree and the subsequent sale of the land.Party F's Purchase: If Party F is interested in buying the land from Party E, they should conduct thorough due diligence, including a title search and verification of all legal documents associated with the property. This will help identify any potential legal issues or encumbrances on the land.Potential Issues: There are several potential issues that could arise in the future, including challenges related to the validity of the compromise decree, the court's order for land registration, and the subdivision and sale of the land without proper registration. Party F should be aware of these potential issues and seek legal advice to assess the risks involved.It's crucial for Party F to consult with a qualified property lawyer in India who can review all relevant documents, assess the legal status of the land, and provide guidance on whether it is advisable to proceed with the purchase. Resolving these legal complexities may require further legal action or negotiations with the parties involved in the original lawsuit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Abandonment of child leaving husband’s home under Section 317 IPC and Section 75",
    "answer": "You cannot be sued under IPC section 317 or section 75 for abandonment of the child, if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the baby in his care. Section 317 of theIndian Penal Codestates that anyone who is the parent or caretaker of a child under twelve years and intentionally leaves the child in a place with the intention of completely abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years, or a fine, or both. Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 states that anyone who leaves a child in any place with the intention of abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to three years, or a fine of one lakh rupees, or both.However, in your case, you are not leaving the child in any place, but in the care of your husband, who is also the child’s father and natural guardian. Therefore, you are not abandoning the child, but merely giving up your custody rights. You are also willing to take care of the child and live separately from your husband, which shows that you are not neglecting or deserting the child. Therefore, you cannot be charged under these sections for abandonment of the child.However, this does not mean that you will not face any legal repercussions if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the child with him. Some of the possible legal consequences are:Your husband may file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or desertion by you under Section 13(1)(ia) or (ib) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. He may also claim alimony or maintenance from you under Section 25 of the same act.Your husband may file for sole custody or guardianship of the child under Section 6 or 7 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. He may also claim child support or maintenance from you under Section 20 of the same act.You may lose your parental rights and responsibilities towards the child, such as your right to visitation, access, education, health, religion, etc. You may also lose your inheritance rights over the child’s property.You may face social stigma and discrimination from your family and society for leaving your husband and child.Therefore, it is advisable that you do not take such a drastic step without considering all the legal and personal implications. You should try to resolve your marital issues amicably with your husband and seek professional help if needed. You should also think about the best interests and welfare of your child and how your decision will affect him or her. You should consult a lawyer for specific guidance on your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Abandonment of child leaving husband’s home under Section 317 IPC and Section 75",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn many legal systems, parents have certain rights and responsibilities towards their children, regardless of whether they are living together or separately. If you decide to live separately from your husband and want to take care of your child, you typically have the following options:Negotiate a Custody Agreement: You and your husband can come to an agreement on child custody and visitation arrangements, either informally or through mediation. This can help establish clear guidelines on how the child's time will be divided between both parents.Legal Custody: Legal custody refers to the right to make important decisions about the child's upbringing, such as education and healthcare. In many cases, both parents continue to share legal custody even if they don't live together.Physical Custody: Physical custody refers to where the child resides. If you have physical custody, the child will primarily live with you, but your husband may still have visitation rights or parenting time.Child Support: If your husband is not the primary caregiver, he may be required to pay child support to help with the child's expenses, even if he has visitation rights.It's important to note that unless there are concerns about the child's safety or well-being, most legal systems prioritize the best interests of the child. Courts generally aim to ensure that both parents have a role in the child's life.Abandonment charges are typically not applicable if you are leaving the child with the other parent, especially if it's agreed upon by both parties. However, you should consult with an attorney in your jurisdiction to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation. They can help you navigate the legal process and protect your rights as well as the best interests of the child.In situations like this, it's often advisable to seek legal counsel early to ensure that your rights as a parent are protected and that any arrangements are made in a legally enforceable manner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You cannot be sued under IPC section 317 or section 75 for abandonment of the child, if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the baby in his care. Section 317 of theIndian Penal Codestates that anyone who is the parent or caretaker of a child under twelve years and intentionally leaves the child in a place with the intention of completely abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years, or a fine, or both. Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 states that anyone who leaves a child in any place with the intention of abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to three years, or a fine of one lakh rupees, or both.However, in your case, you are not leaving the child in any place, but in the care of your husband, who is also the child’s father and natural guardian. Therefore, you are not abandoning the child, but merely giving up your custody rights. You are also willing to take care of the child and live separately from your husband, which shows that you are not neglecting or deserting the child. Therefore, you cannot be charged under these sections for abandonment of the child.However, this does not mean that you will not face any legal repercussions if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the child with him. Some of the possible legal consequences are:Your husband may file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or desertion by you under Section 13(1)(ia) or (ib) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. He may also claim alimony or maintenance from you under Section 25 of the same act.Your husband may file for sole custody or guardianship of the child under Section 6 or 7 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. He may also claim child support or maintenance from you under Section 20 of the same act.You may lose your parental rights and responsibilities towards the child, such as your right to visitation, access, education, health, religion, etc. You may also lose your inheritance rights over the child’s property.You may face social stigma and discrimination from your family and society for leaving your husband and child.Therefore, it is advisable that you do not take such a drastic step without considering all the legal and personal implications. You should try to resolve your marital issues amicably with your husband and seek professional help if needed. You should also think about the best interests and welfare of your child and how your decision will affect him or her. You should consult a lawyer for specific guidance on your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Abandonment of child leaving husband’s home under Section 317 IPC and Section 75",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn many legal systems, parents have certain rights and responsibilities towards their children, regardless of whether they are living together or separately. If you decide to live separately from your husband and want to take care of your child, you typically have the following options:Negotiate a Custody Agreement: You and your husband can come to an agreement on child custody and visitation arrangements, either informally or through mediation. This can help establish clear guidelines on how the child's time will be divided between both parents.Legal Custody: Legal custody refers to the right to make important decisions about the child's upbringing, such as education and healthcare. In many cases, both parents continue to share legal custody even if they don't live together.Physical Custody: Physical custody refers to where the child resides. If you have physical custody, the child will primarily live with you, but your husband may still have visitation rights or parenting time.Child Support: If your husband is not the primary caregiver, he may be required to pay child support to help with the child's expenses, even if he has visitation rights.It's important to note that unless there are concerns about the child's safety or well-being, most legal systems prioritize the best interests of the child. Courts generally aim to ensure that both parents have a role in the child's life.Abandonment charges are typically not applicable if you are leaving the child with the other parent, especially if it's agreed upon by both parties. However, you should consult with an attorney in your jurisdiction to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation. They can help you navigate the legal process and protect your rights as well as the best interests of the child.In situations like this, it's often advisable to seek legal counsel early to ensure that your rights as a parent are protected and that any arrangements are made in a legally enforceable manner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Consult a Legal Expert: It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and real estate matters. They can provide you with specific advice based on the laws and regulations in Chennai, which may vary.Review the Builder's Agreement: Since the builder's agreement mentions \"equal rights in the parking and common areas,\" this can be a crucial piece of evidence to support your claim to the parking space.Association Formation: You mentioned that the owners have not registered an association. Encourage the flat owners to establish a residents' association. Having a formal association can help in managing common issues like parking disputes. The association can work on creating parking rules and demarcating spaces.Negotiate Amicably: Try to have a polite and reasonable conversation with the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat and the local politician. Explain the situation, share your agreement with the builder, and ask them to cooperate in resolving the issue peacefully.Document Everything: Keep records of all communications, including emails, messages, and any written agreements or documents related to the parking space.Mediation: If a direct negotiation doesn't work, consider mediation. A neutral third party can help facilitate a discussion between you and the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat to reach a resolution.Police Complaint: If all else fails, and you believe your rights are being violated, you can file a complaint with the local police station. Present your evidence, including the builder's agreement, and explain the situation. The police may intervene to ensure that your rights are protected.Legal Action: If none of the above steps yield results, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a civil lawsuit. Your attorney can guide you through this process, which can be complex and time-consuming.Remember that property disputes can be complicated and can take time to resolve. Consult with a qualified attorney to understand your specific legal rights and options in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Related to car park in an unregistered apartment building",
    "answer": "According to the Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, the car parking space in an apartment building is a part of the common areas and facilities, which are owned by all the apartment owners in proportion to their respective shares. The car parking space cannot be sold or transferred separately by the builder or any apartment owner. The association of apartment owners has the power to regulate the use and maintenance of the common areas and facilities, including the car parking space.Therefore, if you want to recover your car parking space, you should try to do the following:Check your sale deed and other documents that you have received from the previous flat owner or the builder. See if there is any mention of the car parking space allotted to you or any clause that gives you equal rights in the parking and common areas. If there is, then you have a legal basis to claim your parking space.Talk to the other flat owners who have been allotted car parking spaces and see if they are willing to support you. You can also try to negotiate with the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner and explain to them that you have a right to park your car as per your agreement with the builder. You can also offer to exchange your parking space with another vacant one or pay a reasonable fee for using it.If talking and negotiating does not work, then you can approach the association of apartment owners and file a complaint against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner. You can request the association to intervene and resolve the dispute amicably. You can also ask them to frame clear rules and regulations for the allocation and use of car parking spaces in the building.If the association of apartment owners is not registered or does not exist, then you can try to form one with the consent of at least 60% of the flat owners in the building. You can then register the association under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other applicable law. You can then elect a managing committee and frame bye-laws for the administration of the building, including the car parking space.If none of these steps work, then you can file a complaint with the nearest police station against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner for illegally occupying your parking space and harassing you. You can also file a civil suit in the court for injunction and declaration of your right to park your car in your allotted space.

    "answer": "You cannot be sued under IPC section 317 or section 75 for abandonment of the child, if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the baby in his care. Section 317 of theIndian Penal Codestates that anyone who is the parent or caretaker of a child under twelve years and intentionally leaves the child in a place with the intention of completely abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years, or a fine, or both. Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 states that anyone who leaves a child in any place with the intention of abandoning them can be punished with imprisonment for up to three years, or a fine of one lakh rupees, or both.However, in your case, you are not leaving the child in any place, but in the care of your husband, who is also the child’s father and natural guardian. Therefore, you are not abandoning the child, but merely giving up your custody rights. You are also willing to take care of the child and live separately from your husband, which shows that you are not neglecting or deserting the child. Therefore, you cannot be charged under these sections for abandonment of the child.However, this does not mean that you will not face any legal repercussions if you decide to live separately from your husband and leave the child with him. Some of the possible legal consequences are:Your husband may file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or desertion by you under Section 13(1)(ia) or (ib) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. He may also claim alimony or maintenance from you under Section 25 of the same act.Your husband may file for sole custody or guardianship of the child under Section 6 or 7 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. He may also claim child support or maintenance from you under Section 20 of the same act.You may lose your parental rights and responsibilities towards the child, such as your right to visitation, access, education, health, religion, etc. You may also lose your inheritance rights over the child’s property.You may face social stigma and discrimination from your family and society for leaving your husband and child.Therefore, it is advisable that you do not take such a drastic step without considering all the legal and personal implications. You should try to resolve your marital issues amicably with your husband and seek professional help if needed. You should also think about the best interests and welfare of your child and how your decision will affect him or her. You should consult a lawyer for specific guidance on your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Abandonment of child leaving husband’s home under Section 317 IPC and Section 75",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn many legal systems, parents have certain rights and responsibilities towards their children, regardless of whether they are living together or separately. If you decide to live separately from your husband and want to take care of your child, you typically have the following options:Negotiate a Custody Agreement: You and your husband can come to an agreement on child custody and visitation arrangements, either informally or through mediation. This can help establish clear guidelines on how the child's time will be divided between both parents.Legal Custody: Legal custody refers to the right to make important decisions about the child's upbringing, such as education and healthcare. In many cases, both parents continue to share legal custody even if they don't live together.Physical Custody: Physical custody refers to where the child resides. If you have physical custody, the child will primarily live with you, but your husband may still have visitation rights or parenting time.Child Support: If your husband is not the primary caregiver, he may be required to pay child support to help with the child's expenses, even if he has visitation rights.It's important to note that unless there are concerns about the child's safety or well-being, most legal systems prioritize the best interests of the child. Courts generally aim to ensure that both parents have a role in the child's life.Abandonment charges are typically not applicable if you are leaving the child with the other parent, especially if it's agreed upon by both parties. However, you should consult with an attorney in your jurisdiction to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation. They can help you navigate the legal process and protect your rights as well as the best interests of the child.In situations like this, it's often advisable to seek legal counsel early to ensure that your rights as a parent are protected and that any arrangements are made in a legally enforceable manner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Endorsement of Court on Application - legal meaning and expected steps",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEndorsement \"File\":The endorsement \"filed\" typically means that the court has accepted and received the Interlocutory Application (IA) filed by the opposite party. It indicates that the IA has been formally submitted to the court and is part of the court record.No Order for Org. Plaintiff to File a \"Say\":In some cases, when an IA is filed, the court may not immediately issue orders for the opposite party or the Org. Plaintiff (original plaintiff) to file their responses (commonly referred to as \"say\" or \"counter-affidavit\").The Org. Plaintiff may not be required to take any immediate steps unless the court specifically orders them to do so. However, it's crucial to monitor the progress of the case and follow any further directions or orders issued by the court.Filing a \"Say\" on IA:It is generally a good practice for the Org. Plaintiff to file a response (say) to the IA filed by the opposite party, even if the court has not explicitly ordered it. Filing a response allows the Org. Plaintiff to present their side of the case and arguments related to the IA.It is not always necessary for the court to call for a hearing before accepting or rejecting the IA. The court may decide the IA based on the written submissions of both parties unless it finds it necessary to conduct a hearing.Endorsing \"Filed\":Endorsing \"filed\" typically means that the IA has been officially received and recorded by the court. It does not necessarily render the IA invalid. The court will review the IA, along with any responses filed by the parties, before making a decision on the relief sought in the IA.It's important to note that legal procedures and practices can vary from one case to another and from one court to another. Therefore, it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide specific guidance based on the details of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, as amended in 2005, daughters have equal rights to ancestral property as sons. This means that you, as the daughter of your father, have a right to claim a share in the house that is owned by your father, uncle and aunt. Your mother, as the widow of your father, also has a right to claim a share in the house. Your uncle and aunt cannot kick you out of the house without your consent.To add your mother’s name and your name in the house, you will need to get a legal heir certificate from the revenue department or the tehsildar of your area. This certificate will prove that you are the legal heirs of your father and entitled to inherit his property. You will also need to get a succession certificate from the district court, which will authorize you to represent your father’s estate and transfer his property to your names. You may need to hire a lawyer to help you with these processes.You can also try to negotiate with your uncle and aunt and reach an amicable settlement. You can offer to buy their share of the house or sell your share to them. You can also divide the house into separate portions and live peacefully. However, if they are not willing to cooperate, you can file a suit for partition and injunction in the civil court and seek your rightful share in the house.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientInheritance Rights: When your father passed away, his share in the property would typically be subject to inheritance laws. If there was no will, then the property may be divided among his legal heirs, which generally include his wife (your mother), children, and possibly other immediate family members.Adding Your Mother's Name: To add your mother's name to the property, you would typically need to go through a legal process. This might involve executing a deed of gift or transfer of property in her favor. You should consult with a property lawyer to understand the specific requirements and procedures in your locality.Rights of Co-owners: Your uncle, your dad's sister, and your father were co-owners of the property. After your father's demise, their respective shares would still exist. Your uncle alone cannot kick you out without following the proper legal procedures for partition or sale of the property. Co-owners have certain rights and responsibilities, and it's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the legal implications and potential courses of action.Partition of Property: If you and your co-owners (your uncle and your dad's sister) cannot agree on the property's division or management, any co-owner can file a suit for partition in a civil court. This process would involve dividing the property or selling it and distributing the proceeds according to each co-owner's share.Legal Documentation: Ensure that you have all the necessary legal documents related to the property, including the title deed, will (if any), and records of any financial contributions made towards the property's upkeep or improvements. These documents can be crucial in establishing your rights.Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexity of property matters and variations in laws across different states in India, it is strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and the laws applicable in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If he has not made a will, the laws of intestate succession will determine how his share is distributed. Generally, it will get distributed equally, between your mother and your brother and sister. .Since, you are in possession of the property, you are well placed.Your uncle, as a co-owner, is having certain rights regarding the property. But he does not have the sole authority to \"kick you out\" without proper legal processes.To add your mom's name to the property title, you would typically need to go through a legal process, such as a property transfer or sale, or transfer on the property tax receipts, electricity Bill. This involves various legal process, including filing necessary documents with relevant authorities, paying fees, and ensuring all co-owners (including your uncle and dad's sister) agree to the transfer, if they want to transfer their share in your mother's name.Consult with a lawyer specializing in property law in your area.Rupali RanaitAdvocate, Vasai6 AnswersTalk to Advocate Rupali Ranait"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property rights and partition are governed by various laws and regulations, primarily theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and other personal laws applicable to different religious communities.Based on the information provided, here are some general points to consider:Compromise Agreement: If a woman files a partition suit on her father's ancestral property and enters into a compromise agreement with her father and his sons from the second wife (where the first wife is also a party to the compromise), this agreement is legally binding. The terms of the compromise agreement will dictate how the property is divided, whether it is through a monetary settlement or otherwise.Children's Rights: If the woman has adult children who were not parties to the compromise agreement, they may have a claim to the ancestral property or its proceeds, depending on the specific terms of the compromise agreement and the applicable laws.Legal Rights of Children: Under Indian law, children, whether minor or adult, may have a legal right to the ancestral property of their father. If they were not part of the compromise agreement, their rights may not have been extinguished.Partition of Ancestral Property: Ancestral property rights are governed by specific rules and laws. Generally, ancestral property can be partitioned among the legal heirs, and such partition should ideally include all the legal heirs, which may include the children of the woman.Challenging the Compromise: If the children believe that their rights to the ancestral property were not adequately protected or considered in the compromise agreement, they may have the option to challenge the agreement in court. However, the success of such a challenge would depend on the specific circumstances and legal arguments presented.Legal Counsel: It is highly advisable for the children to consult with a qualified attorney in India who specializes in property and family law. An attorney can review the specifics of the compromise agreement, assess the children's rights, and provide guidance on the best course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

They first have to get themselves impleaded as parties to the appeal after which they can think about the maintainability of the proposed challenge to the exparte decision of the condone delay petition.3. When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5. The court will implead the LRs but the challenge against the decision to condone the delay may not be entertained by court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share.

Grounds for quashing may include the absence of any prima facie case, abuse of process, or a case devoid of merit. The court may quash the proceedings if it finds that the case is maliciously filed or an abuse of the legal process.Stay Order:You can also approach the High Court to seek a stay order on the DV case proceedings until the matter is resolved through the quashing petition. The court may grant a stay order if it believes that there are valid reasons to halt the lower court proceedings until the High Court makes a decision on your quashing petition.Defending the Case:Simultaneously, you should engage a skilled lawyer to defend you in the DV case. Your lawyer can present evidence, including the photograph of all four of you at the airport, to establish that you were not present at the alleged time and date of the incident. Your lawyer can also cross-examine witnesses and present other evidence to prove the falsity of the complaint.Mediation:You may consider mediation as an option to resolve the dispute amicably, but this depends on the willingness of both parties to participate.It's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney in India who can review your specific case details and guide you through the legal process.

    "answer": "To accomplish your wish of releasing your share or rights in your father’s property in Bangalore, Karnataka, you will need to execute a release deed in favour of your surviving brother or the wife of your deceased brother or both. A release deed is a legal document that transfers your interest or claim in a property to another person without any monetary consideration. A release deed can be executed by any person who has a right or share in a property, either by inheritance, gift, or will.Some of the documentations required for executing a release deed are:The original title deed of the propertyThe will of your fatherThe death certificates of your father, mother, and deceased brotherThe identity proofs and address proofs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe passport size photographs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe stamp paper of appropriate value as per the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957The registration fee as per the Karnataka Registration Rules, 1965You do not need the consent of all your siblings to execute a release deed, as long as you are releasing only your share or rights in the property. However, it is advisable to inform them about your decision and obtain their no objection certificates (NOCs) to avoid any future disputes or challenges to the release deed.Your presence in India is not a must for executing a release deed. You can accomplish this through a power of attorney (POA) given to a trusted person in India who can act on your behalf. However, you will need to follow certain steps to make a valid POA from abroad. These steps are:Draft a POA document on a plain paper with all the details and terms of the authority given to your agent in India.Sign the POA document and get it attested by a notary public or the Indian consulate or embassy in your country of residence.Send the attested POA document to your agent in India by courier or registered post.Ask your agent to get the POA document stamped/adjudicated and registered in India within three months of receiving it.Ask your agent to use the POA document to execute the release deed on your behalfThe process of executing a release deed through a POA may take around one to two months, depending on various factors such as the availability of documents, the stamp duty and registration charges, the verification process, etc. The approximate cost of executing a release deed through a POA may vary from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000, depending on the value of the property, the stamp duty and registration fee applicable in Karnataka, the notary and courier charges, etc.Some other things that you should be aware of are:A release deed is irrevocable and cannot be cancelled once executed.A release deed should be clear and unambiguous and should mention the names, addresses, and relationships of all the parties involved.A release deed should be witnessed by at least two independent witnesses who are not related to any of the parties involved.A release deed should be registered with the sub-registrar’s office within whose jurisdiction the property is situated.A release deed should be executed within 12 years from the date of death of your father or from the date when you became aware of your right or share in the propertyMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear clientAccomplishing Your Wish:To release your share/rights, you can execute a Release Deed in favor of your surviving brother or equally between your surviving brother and the wife of your deceased brother.Required Documentations:You will need the following documents:The unregistered Will of your father.A Release Deed, which needs to be drafted by a lawyer.Proof of identity and address.Death certificates of your father, eldest brother, and mother.Legal heir certificates for all legal heirs.Consent of Siblings:Ideally, it's best to have the consent of all your siblings to avoid potential disputes. However, you may still be able to execute the Release Deed without their consent, especially if you can demonstrate that your father's Will specifically allocated the property to the three sons.Presence in India or Power of Attorney (POA):You can accomplish this through a Power of Attorney (POA) if you appoint a trusted representative in India to act on your behalf. The POA should be executed in the USA and then attested at the Indian consulate. Your physical presence in India may not be necessary.Timeframe and Cost:The time and cost can vary depending on the complexity of your case, local legal requirements, and the efficiency of the legal process. It's best to consult with an attorney to get a more accurate estimate.Other Considerations:Transferring the Khata: It is advisable to transfer the Khata from your father's name to your names before executing the Release Deed, as this will establish your ownership.Unregistered Will: While an unregistered Will is valid, it may face additional scrutiny. You may need to prove its authenticity in court.Regarding the \"12 years from the date of death\" clause, the limitation period for challenging a Will may vary by jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. Consult with your attorney to understand how this may apply to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

So to determine that question it can also return a finding as regards the LA award being fraudulent or not. The LA award relates to a dispute raised in the execution proceedings and nothing stops the execution court from deciding thatAs the LA award was obtained fraudulently it is non est in the eyes of law and does not affect the decree at all and as per the dictum of the SC such a fraud vitiates all acts, ecclesiastical as well as temporal or even a judicial act. In your case fraud was practiced on the LA and the award was obtained.The JD cannot bypass the procedure of filing an appeal by securing a fraudulent LA award. Though the JD had filed the appeal but that appeal was not decided on merits and was referred to the lok adalat where it came to be disposed of by virtue of the fraudulent LA award. So the court never got an opportunity to apply its mind as regards the grounds of challenge raised in the appeal.

The Supreme Court further observed that if the signatures of the Plaintiff.It is settled law thatexecuting court cannot go beyond the decree.it must take the decree as it stands, for the decree is binding and conclusive between the parties to the suit”.But the difficulty arises when there is ambiguity in the decree with regard to the material aspects. Then it becomes the bounden duty of the court to interpret the decree in the process of giving a true effect to the decree. At that juncture the executing court has to be very cautious in supplementing its interpretation and conscious of the fact that it cannot draw a new decree. The executing court shall strike a fine balance between the two while exercising this jurisdiction in the processof giving effect to the decree.However in yor case, if the executing court is taking any decision against your petition, then you may prefer an appeal against the lok adalat decree stating that the opponent played fraud  hence the same is null and void  and the same court has powers to rectify the decree due to the fraud played on it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Consult a Legal Expert: It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and real estate matters. They can provide you with specific advice based on the laws and regulations in Chennai, which may vary.Review the Builder's Agreement: Since the builder's agreement mentions \"equal rights in the parking and common areas,\" this can be a crucial piece of evidence to support your claim to the parking space.Association Formation: You mentioned that the owners have not registered an association. Encourage the flat owners to establish a residents' association. Having a formal association can help in managing common issues like parking disputes. The association can work on creating parking rules and demarcating spaces.Negotiate Amicably: Try to have a polite and reasonable conversation with the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat and the local politician. Explain the situation, share your agreement with the builder, and ask them to cooperate in resolving the issue peacefully.Document Everything: Keep records of all communications, including emails, messages, and any written agreements or documents related to the parking space.Mediation: If a direct negotiation doesn't work, consider mediation. A neutral third party can help facilitate a discussion between you and the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat to reach a resolution.Police Complaint: If all else fails, and you believe your rights are being violated, you can file a complaint with the local police station. Present your evidence, including the builder's agreement, and explain the situation. The police may intervene to ensure that your rights are protected.Legal Action: If none of the above steps yield results, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a civil lawsuit. Your attorney can guide you through this process, which can be complex and time-consuming.Remember that property disputes can be complicated and can take time to resolve. Consult with a qualified attorney to understand your specific legal rights and options in your jurisdiction.

    "answer": "According to the Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, the car parking space in an apartment building is a part of the common areas and facilities, which are owned by all the apartment owners in proportion to their respective shares. The car parking space cannot be sold or transferred separately by the builder or any apartment owner. The association of apartment owners has the power to regulate the use and maintenance of the common areas and facilities, including the car parking space.Therefore, if you want to recover your car parking space, you should try to do the following:Check your sale deed and other documents that you have received from the previous flat owner or the builder. See if there is any mention of the car parking space allotted to you or any clause that gives you equal rights in the parking and common areas. If there is, then you have a legal basis to claim your parking space.Talk to the other flat owners who have been allotted car parking spaces and see if they are willing to support you. You can also try to negotiate with the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner and explain to them that you have a right to park your car as per your agreement with the builder. You can also offer to exchange your parking space with another vacant one or pay a reasonable fee for using it.If talking and negotiating does not work, then you can approach the association of apartment owners and file a complaint against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner. You can request the association to intervene and resolve the dispute amicably. You can also ask them to frame clear rules and regulations for the allocation and use of car parking spaces in the building.If the association of apartment owners is not registered or does not exist, then you can try to form one with the consent of at least 60% of the flat owners in the building. You can then register the association under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other applicable law. You can then elect a managing committee and frame bye-laws for the administration of the building, including the car parking space.If none of these steps work, then you can file a complaint with the nearest police station against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner for illegally occupying your parking space and harassing you. You can also file a civil suit in the court for injunction and declaration of your right to park your car in your allotted space.

If there was no will, then the property may be divided among his legal heirs, which generally include his wife (your mother), children, and possibly other immediate family members.Adding Your Mother's Name: To add your mother's name to the property, you would typically need to go through a legal process. This might involve executing a deed of gift or transfer of property in her favor. You should consult with a property lawyer to understand the specific requirements and procedures in your locality.Rights of Co-owners: Your uncle, your dad's sister, and your father were co-owners of the property. After your father's demise, their respective shares would still exist. Your uncle alone cannot kick you out without following the proper legal procedures for partition or sale of the property. Co-owners have certain rights and responsibilities, and it's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the legal implications and potential courses of action.Partition of Property: If you and your co-owners (your uncle and your dad's sister) cannot agree on the property's division or management, any co-owner can file a suit for partition in a civil court. This process would involve dividing the property or selling it and distributing the proceeds according to each co-owner's share.Legal Documentation: Ensure that you have all the necessary legal documents related to the property, including the title deed, will (if any), and records of any financial contributions made towards the property's upkeep or improvements. These documents can be crucial in establishing your rights.Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexity of property matters and variations in laws across different states in India, it is strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and the laws applicable in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Release Deed, Property in Bangalore, Karnataka",
    "answer": "To accomplish your wish of releasing your share or rights in your father’s property in Bangalore, Karnataka, you will need to execute a release deed in favour of your surviving brother or the wife of your deceased brother or both. A release deed is a legal document that transfers your interest or claim in a property to another person without any monetary consideration. A release deed can be executed by any person who has a right or share in a property, either by inheritance, gift, or will.Some of the documentations required for executing a release deed are:The original title deed of the propertyThe will of your fatherThe death certificates of your father, mother, and deceased brotherThe identity proofs and address proofs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe passport size photographs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe stamp paper of appropriate value as per the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957The registration fee as per the Karnataka Registration Rules, 1965You do not need the consent of all your siblings to execute a release deed, as long as you are releasing only your share or rights in the property. However, it is advisable to inform them about your decision and obtain their no objection certificates (NOCs) to avoid any future disputes or challenges to the release deed.Your presence in India is not a must for executing a release deed. You can accomplish this through a power of attorney (POA) given to a trusted person in India who can act on your behalf. However, you will need to follow certain steps to make a valid POA from abroad. These steps are:Draft a POA document on a plain paper with all the details and terms of the authority given to your agent in India.Sign the POA document and get it attested by a notary public or the Indian consulate or embassy in your country of residence.Send the attested POA document to your agent in India by courier or registered post.Ask your agent to get the POA document stamped/adjudicated and registered in India within three months of receiving it.Ask your agent to use the POA document to execute the release deed on your behalfThe process of executing a release deed through a POA may take around one to two months, depending on various factors such as the availability of documents, the stamp duty and registration charges, the verification process, etc. The approximate cost of executing a release deed through a POA may vary from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000, depending on the value of the property, the stamp duty and registration fee applicable in Karnataka, the notary and courier charges, etc.Some other things that you should be aware of are:A release deed is irrevocable and cannot be cancelled once executed.A release deed should be clear and unambiguous and should mention the names, addresses, and relationships of all the parties involved.A release deed should be witnessed by at least two independent witnesses who are not related to any of the parties involved.A release deed should be registered with the sub-registrar’s office within whose jurisdiction the property is situated.A release deed should be executed within 12 years from the date of death of your father or from the date when you became aware of your right or share in the propertyMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can borrower change its name during the lone tenure",
    "answer": "Dear ClientChanging the name of your company, and thereby the name of the borrower in an existing 'Loan against Property' (LAP), is a legal process. However, it involves several steps and considerations, and you should follow the legal procedures carefully to ensure that your request is valid and that the lender, in this case, Indiabulls Commercial Credit Ltd. (ICCL), has no legal grounds to deny your request.Here are the steps you should follow:Alteration of Certificate of Enlistment (CE): To change the name of your company, you should apply to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation for a modification in the details of your existing CE. This is a common legal procedure, and if all the other details such as the address and sole proprietorship nature of the company remain the same, it should be acceptable.Inform ICCL: Once you have successfully changed the name of your company with the updated CE, you should inform ICCL immediately. Provide them with the updated CE and any other necessary documentation related to the name change. It's essential to keep your lender informed about such changes.Loan Agreement Amendment: ICCL should amend the loan agreement to reflect the new name of the borrower (your updated company name). They might also need to update any other relevant documents. The new name of the borrower should match the details on your updated CE.Co-Applicant and Guarantor: If your wife is a co-applicant and guarantor on the loan, ICCL should also be informed about the name change. Any necessary amendments should be made to the loan agreement reflecting her updated role and the updated company name.UDYAM Certificate: Update your UDYAM certificate with the new company name and provide the updated certificate to ICCL to ensure they have the correct information on record.Legal Consultation: It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or attorney who specializes in corporate and financial matters to ensure that all legal requirements are met during this process.ICCL should not have any legal grounds to deny your request if you follow the legal procedures for changing your company's name and promptly inform them about the changes. However, it's essential to maintain transparency and follow all necessary legal steps to avoid any potential issues.Additionally, you should carefully review your loan agreement with ICCL to ensure that there are no specific clauses or conditions that may impact your ability to change the borrower's name. If in doubt, seek legal advice to interpret the terms of your loan agreement accurately.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Forced mutual consent - options to modify the settlement",
    "answer": "A mutual divorce petition is a legal document that expresses the consent of both the spouses to end their marriage and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, property division, etc. Once the petition is filed, the court will give a six-month cooling-off period for the parties to reconsider their decision and try to reconcile. After six months, the parties have to appear before the court again and confirm their consent for the second motion. If both the parties are still willing to divorce, the court will grant a decree ofdivorce by mutual consent.However, if one of the parties changes their mind or is not satisfied with the settlement terms, they can withdraw their consent at any stage before the decree is passed. The consent given by the parties must be free and voluntary, and not obtained by force, fraud, or undue influence. If one of the parties proves that they were coerced or deceived into signing the petition, the court will not grant adivorce by mutual consent.Therefore, you have some options after filing a mutual divorce petition:You can try to negotiate with your wife and her family and reach a fair and reasonable settlement that protects your business interests. You can also seek the help of a mediator or a lawyer to facilitate the discussion and draft a new agreement.You can withdraw your consent for the second motion and contest the divorce on other grounds such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, etc. You can also challenge the validity of the petition and prove that you were forced to sign it. However, this may lead to a long and bitter legal battle that may affect your personal and professional life.You can abide by the terms of the settlement and get adivorce by mutual consent. However, this may result in a loss of your property rights and business assets.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "She can very well write a Will without waiting for mutation.1) If the beneficiary dies, the testator may very well bequeath her property to anyone else of her choice by writing a new Will. The old Will becomes null and void automatically.2) There is no need to execute the Will. Inheritance through the Will is automatic.

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Firstly the Will shall come into force only after the death of the testator.Secondly, once the Will comes into force and unfortunately if the beneficiary is not able to transfer the properties to his/her name during the lifetime, then it shall automatically devolve on the legal heirs of the beneficiary.The testator has full rights to cancel the Will or change it or make a codicil of the Will during his/her lifetime.Therefore in the event of the death of the beneficiary before the Will comes into force and the testator wants to cancel the Will consequent upon the death of the beneficiary, then the legal heirs of the cannot claim the benefits for any reason neither they will have any rights to challenge the cancellation of the Will by the testator upon the death of the beneficiary.If the testator would like this property bequeathed in the Will should go to the beneficiary alone or in the event of his/her death during the lifetime of the testator, then the testator can make a recital stating the consequent upon the death of the beneficiary before the enforcement of the Will the property bequeathed shall go to the second named beneficiary for whatever reason the testator may rely upon.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Related to car park in an unregistered apartment building",
    "answer": "Consult a Legal Expert: It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and real estate matters. They can provide you with specific advice based on the laws and regulations in Chennai, which may vary.Review the Builder's Agreement: Since the builder's agreement mentions \"equal rights in the parking and common areas,\" this can be a crucial piece of evidence to support your claim to the parking space.Association Formation: You mentioned that the owners have not registered an association. Encourage the flat owners to establish a residents' association. Having a formal association can help in managing common issues like parking disputes. The association can work on creating parking rules and demarcating spaces.Negotiate Amicably: Try to have a polite and reasonable conversation with the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat and the local politician. Explain the situation, share your agreement with the builder, and ask them to cooperate in resolving the issue peacefully.Document Everything: Keep records of all communications, including emails, messages, and any written agreements or documents related to the parking space.Mediation: If a direct negotiation doesn't work, consider mediation. A neutral third party can help facilitate a discussion between you and the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat to reach a resolution.Police Complaint: If all else fails, and you believe your rights are being violated, you can file a complaint with the local police station. Present your evidence, including the builder's agreement, and explain the situation. The police may intervene to ensure that your rights are protected.Legal Action: If none of the above steps yield results, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a civil lawsuit. Your attorney can guide you through this process, which can be complex and time-consuming.Remember that property disputes can be complicated and can take time to resolve. Consult with a qualified attorney to understand your specific legal rights and options in your jurisdiction. Legal advice tailored to your situation is essential to pursue the most appropriate course of action.To know more about the legal aspect  you can call me"

    "question": "Related to car park in an unregistered apartment building",
    "answer": "According to the Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, the car parking space in an apartment building is a part of the common areas and facilities, which are owned by all the apartment owners in proportion to their respective shares. The car parking space cannot be sold or transferred separately by the builder or any apartment owner. The association of apartment owners has the power to regulate the use and maintenance of the common areas and facilities, including the car parking space.Therefore, if you want to recover your car parking space, you should try to do the following:Check your sale deed and other documents that you have received from the previous flat owner or the builder. See if there is any mention of the car parking space allotted to you or any clause that gives you equal rights in the parking and common areas. If there is, then you have a legal basis to claim your parking space.Talk to the other flat owners who have been allotted car parking spaces and see if they are willing to support you. You can also try to negotiate with the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner and explain to them that you have a right to park your car as per your agreement with the builder. You can also offer to exchange your parking space with another vacant one or pay a reasonable fee for using it.If talking and negotiating does not work, then you can approach the association of apartment owners and file a complaint against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner. You can request the association to intervene and resolve the dispute amicably. You can also ask them to frame clear rules and regulations for the allocation and use of car parking spaces in the building.If the association of apartment owners is not registered or does not exist, then you can try to form one with the consent of at least 60% of the flat owners in the building. You can then register the association under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other applicable law. You can then elect a managing committee and frame bye-laws for the administration of the building, including the car parking space.If none of these steps work, then you can file a complaint with the nearest police station against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner for illegally occupying your parking space and harassing you. You can also file a civil suit in the court for injunction and declaration of your right to park your car in your allotted space. You will need a lawyer to help you with these legal actions.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientInheritance Rights: When your father passed away, his share in the property would typically be subject to inheritance laws. If there was no will, then the property may be divided among his legal heirs, which generally include his wife (your mother), children, and possibly other immediate family members.Adding Your Mother's Name: To add your mother's name to the property, you would typically need to go through a legal process. This might involve executing a deed of gift or transfer of property in her favor. You should consult with a property lawyer to understand the specific requirements and procedures in your locality.Rights of Co-owners: Your uncle, your dad's sister, and your father were co-owners of the property. After your father's demise, their respective shares would still exist. Your uncle alone cannot kick you out without following the proper legal procedures for partition or sale of the property. Co-owners have certain rights and responsibilities, and it's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand the legal implications and potential courses of action.Partition of Property: If you and your co-owners (your uncle and your dad's sister) cannot agree on the property's division or management, any co-owner can file a suit for partition in a civil court. This process would involve dividing the property or selling it and distributing the proceeds according to each co-owner's share.Legal Documentation: Ensure that you have all the necessary legal documents related to the property, including the title deed, will (if any), and records of any financial contributions made towards the property's upkeep or improvements. These documents can be crucial in establishing your rights.Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexity of property matters and variations in laws across different states in India, it is strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and the laws applicable in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registry through POA",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThe validity of a property registry arrangement where the seller appoints a relative via a registered Power of Attorney (POA) can vary depending on the laws and regulations of the specific jurisdiction where the property is located. Here are some general considerations:Validity of the POA: First and foremost, the POA itself must be valid and legally recognized in the jurisdiction where the property is located. This typically involves ensuring that the POA is properly executed, notarized, and complies with local laws.Specific Powers Granted: The POA document should clearly state the specific powers granted to the relative. It's essential that the POA explicitly authorizes the relative to execute the property sale or registry on behalf of the seller.Local Laws and Regulations: Different jurisdictions may have specific rules and regulations regarding the use of POAs in property transactions. Some jurisdictions may require additional documentation or may limit the use of POAs in property transactions.Verification of the Relative's Identity: The authorities overseeing the property registry may require verification of the relative's identity and relationship to the seller to ensure that the POA is not being misused.Title Search and Due Diligence: It's crucial to conduct a thorough title search and due diligence on the property to ensure that there are no existing disputes or encumbrances that could affect the validity of the sale.Legal Advice: It's highly advisable to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate law in the jurisdiction where the property is located. They can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and potential challenges related to the use of a POA in property transactions.Consular Attestation: If the seller is a non-resident of the country where the property is located, consular attestation of the POA may be required in some cases. This involves having the POA authenticated by the consulate or embassy of the seller's home country.Recording the Deed: After the property registry is completed, it's important to ensure that the deed is properly recorded with the relevant local authorities to establish clear ownership.In summary, the validity of a property registry arrangement using a POA appointed to a relative can depend on a variety of factors, including local laws, the specific language and powers granted in the POA, and any additional requirements in the jurisdiction. It's crucial to seek legal advice and follow the proper procedures to ensure the transaction is valid and legally recognized.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "New business setup paperwork needed with cost",
    "answer": "Dear ClientSetting up a company involves several legal and administrative steps. Here are some legal remedies and considerations for starting your e-commerce business with multiple brands under it:Required Paperwork and Costs:a. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): If you plan to share proprietary information with third-party manufacturers, it's advisable to have them sign an NDA to protect your intellectual property. Legal costs for drafting an NDA can vary but are typically reasonable.b. GST Registration: If your annual turnover is expected to exceed the prescribed threshold (which varies by country), you may need to register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) or its equivalent. The cost for GST registration can vary depending on your location.c. CIN (Company Identification Number): If you choose to register your company as a Private Limited Company or Limited Company, you'll receive a Corporate Identification Number (CIN). The cost of incorporating such companies can vary but is usually higher compared to other business structures.d. Trademark Registration: To protect your brand names and logos, it's advisable to register trademarks. The costs for trademark registration vary based on the number of classes you register under and the region/country in which you seek protection.Choice of Business Structure:You mentioned considering Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or One Person Company (OPC). The choice of business structure should be based on various factors, including your long-term business goals, tax implications, and liability. Here are some points to consider:LLP: Provides limited liability for partners and is relatively easier to set up compared to a Private Limited Company. Tax implications can be favorable, as LLPs are often taxed similarly to partnerships. Annual compliance costs are generally lower compared to companies.OPC: Suitable if you want to operate as a single owner. OPCs also offer limited liability. Tax implications depend on your income and may be similar to those of sole proprietorships or individual taxation.Consult with a chartered accountant (CA) or tax consultant to assess the tax implications based on your specific circumstances.Annual Maintenance Expense:The annual maintenance expenses for a company can vary depending on its structure, size, and compliance requirements. Generally, an LLP has lower annual compliance costs compared to a Private Limited Company. Expect to incur expenses related to accounting, annual filings, audits, and other statutory compliance requirements. Consulting a CA can help estimate these costs more accurately.Choosing a Professional:Chartered Accountant (CA): CAs specialize in taxation, financial planning, and compliance. They can assist with GST registration, tax planning, and financial matters.Corporate Lawyer: Corporate lawyers specialize in legal aspects of business, including drafting contracts, agreements, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They can help with drafting NDAs, shareholder agreements, and other legal documents.Attorney: An attorney can provide legal advice and draft legal documents, but their expertise may vary depending on their specialization.It's often advisable to consult both a CA and a corporate lawyer to cover both financial and legal aspects of your business. They can provide comprehensive guidance on the setup and ongoing compliance requirements of your company.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A release deed is a legal document that transfers your interest or claim in a property to another person without any monetary consideration. A release deed can be executed by any person who has a right or share in a property, either by inheritance, gift, or will.Some of the documentations required for executing a release deed are:The original title deed of the propertyThe will of your fatherThe death certificates of your father, mother, and deceased brotherThe identity proofs and address proofs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe passport size photographs of yourself and the other parties involvedThe stamp paper of appropriate value as per the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957The registration fee as per the Karnataka Registration Rules, 1965You do not need the consent of all your siblings to execute a release deed, as long as you are releasing only your share or rights in the property.

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Forced mutual consent - options to modify the settlement",
    "answer": "A mutual divorce petition is a legal document that expresses the consent of both the spouses to end their marriage and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, property division, etc. Once the petition is filed, the court will give a six-month cooling-off period for the parties to reconsider their decision and try to reconcile. After six months, the parties have to appear before the court again and confirm their consent for the second motion. If both the parties are still willing to divorce, the court will grant a decree ofdivorce by mutual consent.However, if one of the parties changes their mind or is not satisfied with the settlement terms, they can withdraw their consent at any stage before the decree is passed. The consent given by the parties must be free and voluntary, and not obtained by force, fraud, or undue influence. If one of the parties proves that they were coerced or deceived into signing the petition, the court will not grant adivorce by mutual consent.Therefore, you have some options after filing a mutual divorce petition:You can try to negotiate with your wife and her family and reach a fair and reasonable settlement that protects your business interests. You can also seek the help of a mediator or a lawyer to facilitate the discussion and draft a new agreement.You can withdraw your consent for the second motion and contest the divorce on other grounds such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, etc. You can also challenge the validity of the petition and prove that you were forced to sign it. However, this may lead to a long and bitter legal battle that may affect your personal and professional life.You can abide by the terms of the settlement and get adivorce by mutual consent. However, this may result in a loss of your property rights and business assets.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Property rights of daughters in the presence of unregistered will in Karnataka",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court ruling in 2020, daughters have equal rights as sons in the ancestral property of their father, even if he died before the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 came into force. However, this ruling applies only to coparcenary property, which is the property inherited by a Hindu male from his father, grandfather or great-grandfather. Self-acquired property, which is the property acquired by a Hindu male by his own efforts or resources, is not coparcenary property and does not fall under the ambit of this ruling.In your case, since your father’s property in Jayanagar, Bangalore was his self-acquired property and not ancestral property, the Supreme Court ruling does not affect your sisters’ rights to it. Your father had the absolute right to dispose of his self-acquired property by a will according to his wishes. Therefore, your sisters do not have any legal claim to the property as per the will made by your father in 1995.However, this does not mean that your sisters cannot challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They can file a suit for declaration and cancellation of the will on various grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, forgery, lack of testamentary capacity or intention, improper execution or attestation, revocation or alteration of the will etc. If they choose to do so, you and your brothers will have to defend the will and prove its genuineness and validity. You will also have to seek legal representation from a lawyer who specializes in property and succession matters.Given this scenario, it is advisable to obtain probate of the will from a competent court. Probate is a legal process that verifies and certifies the authenticity and validity of a will under the seal of the court. Probate can be granted only to the executor appointed by the will or his legal representative. In your case, since you are one of the executors named in the will, you can apply for probate along with your brothers. The process of obtaining probate involves filing a petition in the court along with the original will and other documents such as death certificate of the testator, consent letters from other executors or beneficiaries, affidavit of witnesses etc. The court will issue notices to all the legal heirs of the testator and also publish a citation in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have an interest in the estate. If there are no objections or if they are dismissed by the court, the court will grant probate after verifying the documents and evidence. The probate will act as conclusive proof of the validity of the will and prevent any future disputes or litigation over the property.Without going to court, another option is to mediate this matter through a lawyer or an arbitrator who can help you and your sisters reach an amicable settlement. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process where a neutral third party facilitates communication and negotiation between the parties and helps them resolve their differences without imposing any decision on them. Mediation can save time, money and emotional stress involved in litigation and also preserve family harmony. However, mediation requires consent and cooperation from all the parties involved. If any party is unwilling or unable to participate in mediation or if mediation fails to produce a satisfactory outcome, then litigation may be inevitable.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSupreme Court Ruling on Property Rights of Daughters:The Supreme Court of India ruled that daughters have equal rights in ancestral property. However, your situation involves self-acquired property and a will executed by your father, which allocates the property to his sons. Generally, self-acquired property can be disposed of by the owner as per their wishes through a valid will.a. If the will clearly allocates the property to his sons, it may not be subject to the 2020 Supreme Court ruling on daughters' rights in ancestral property. However, legal interpretations can vary, and your sisters may choose to contest this in court.b. If your sisters contest the will, it's advisable for the brothers to seek legal representation to protect their interests and defend the validity of the will.Probate of Will:In India, the probate of a will is not mandatory but can be beneficial for establishing the validity of the will. Whether it is recommended depends on various factors, including local laws and the circumstances surrounding the will.a. Any interested party can initiate the probate process. Typically, the executor mentioned in the will or one of the beneficiaries does this.b. The outcome of the probate process depends on whether the court finds the will valid. If the will is found valid, it will be legally recognized and can be executed according to its terms.Mediation or Arbitration:Mediation or arbitration can be an alternative to litigation if all parties involved are willing to negotiate and reach a settlement. It's a less adversarial approach and can save time and costs.a. Yes, mediation through a qualified mediator or arbitrator is an option. However, all parties must agree to participate in the process.b. I cannot recommend specific mediators or arbitrators in Bangalore. You may need to research and consult with legal professionals or organizations that offer mediation services to find a suitable mediator.Regarding the approximate charges for legal services, it varies widely depending on the complexity of the case, the location, and the lawyer's fees.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it involves several steps and considerations, and you should follow the legal procedures carefully to ensure that your request is valid and that the lender, in this case, Indiabulls Commercial Credit Ltd. (ICCL), has no legal grounds to deny your request.Here are the steps you should follow:Alteration of Certificate of Enlistment (CE): To change the name of your company, you should apply to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation for a modification in the details of your existing CE. This is a common legal procedure, and if all the other details such as the address and sole proprietorship nature of the company remain the same, it should be acceptable.Inform ICCL: Once you have successfully changed the name of your company with the updated CE, you should inform ICCL immediately. Provide them with the updated CE and any other necessary documentation related to the name change. It's essential to keep your lender informed about such changes.Loan Agreement Amendment: ICCL should amend the loan agreement to reflect the new name of the borrower (your updated company name). They might also need to update any other relevant documents. The new name of the borrower should match the details on your updated CE.Co-Applicant and Guarantor: If your wife is a co-applicant and guarantor on the loan, ICCL should also be informed about the name change. Any necessary amendments should be made to the loan agreement reflecting her updated role and the updated company name.UDYAM Certificate: Update your UDYAM certificate with the new company name and provide the updated certificate to ICCL to ensure they have the correct information on record.Legal Consultation: It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or attorney who specializes in corporate and financial matters to ensure that all legal requirements are met during this process.ICCL should not have any legal grounds to deny your request if you follow the legal procedures for changing your company's name and promptly inform them about the changes. However, it's essential to maintain transparency and follow all necessary legal steps to avoid any potential issues.Additionally, you should carefully review your loan agreement with ICCL to ensure that there are no specific clauses or conditions that may impact your ability to change the borrower's name.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Firstly the Will shall come into force only after the death of the testator.Secondly, once the Will comes into force and unfortunately if the beneficiary is not able to transfer the properties to his/her name during the lifetime, then it shall automatically devolve on the legal heirs of the beneficiary.The testator has full rights to cancel the Will or change it or make a codicil of the Will during his/her lifetime.Therefore in the event of the death of the beneficiary before the Will comes into force and the testator wants to cancel the Will consequent upon the death of the beneficiary, then the legal heirs of the cannot claim the benefits for any reason neither they will have any rights to challenge the cancellation of the Will by the testator upon the death of the beneficiary.If the testator would like this property bequeathed in the Will should go to the beneficiary alone or in the event of his/her death during the lifetime of the testator, then the testator can make a recital stating the consequent upon the death of the beneficiary before the enforcement of the Will the property bequeathed shall go to the second named beneficiary for whatever reason the testator may rely upon.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientInheritance Rights: When your father passed away, his share in the property would typically be subject to inheritance laws. If there was no will, then the property may be divided among his legal heirs, which generally include his wife (your mother), children, and possibly other immediate family members.Adding Your Mother's Name: To add your mother's name to the property, you would typically need to go through a legal process. This might involve executing a deed of gift or transfer of property in her favor. You should consult with a property lawyer to understand the specific requirements and procedures in your locality.Rights of Co-owners: Your uncle, your dad's sister, and your father were co-owners of the property.

This process would involve dividing the property or selling it and distributing the proceeds according to each co-owner's share.Legal Documentation: Ensure that you have all the necessary legal documents related to the property, including the title deed, will (if any), and records of any financial contributions made towards the property's upkeep or improvements.

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "answer": "1. The LRs of the deceased can file a petition before the appellate court intimating the death of the plaintiff and to implead the LRs in the appeal suit.2. They first have to get themselves impleaded as parties to the appeal after which they can think about the maintainability of the proposed challenge to the exparte decision of the condone delay petition.3. When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5. The court will implead the LRs but the challenge against the decision to condone the delay may not be entertained by court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

It mentions the court's decision and explicitly states the intention of the releasors (the legal heirs of the plaintiff) to release their inherited share in favor of the releasees for a monetary consideration.Effect on the Appeal: The language used in the Release Deed seems to acknowledge the plaintiff's entitlement as per the preliminary decree. This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share.

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Forced mutual consent - options to modify the settlement",
    "answer": "A mutual divorce petition is a legal document that expresses the consent of both the spouses to end their marriage and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, property division, etc. Once the petition is filed, the court will give a six-month cooling-off period for the parties to reconsider their decision and try to reconcile. After six months, the parties have to appear before the court again and confirm their consent for the second motion. If both the parties are still willing to divorce, the court will grant a decree ofdivorce by mutual consent.However, if one of the parties changes their mind or is not satisfied with the settlement terms, they can withdraw their consent at any stage before the decree is passed. The consent given by the parties must be free and voluntary, and not obtained by force, fraud, or undue influence. If one of the parties proves that they were coerced or deceived into signing the petition, the court will not grant adivorce by mutual consent.Therefore, you have some options after filing a mutual divorce petition:You can try to negotiate with your wife and her family and reach a fair and reasonable settlement that protects your business interests. You can also seek the help of a mediator or a lawyer to facilitate the discussion and draft a new agreement.You can withdraw your consent for the second motion and contest the divorce on other grounds such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, etc. You can also challenge the validity of the petition and prove that you were forced to sign it. However, this may lead to a long and bitter legal battle that may affect your personal and professional life.You can abide by the terms of the settlement and get adivorce by mutual consent. However, this may result in a loss of your property rights and business assets.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is not understood that on what basis you have been advised for re-allotment by DDA .Where is the question of re-allotment because the original allottee is not alive and his legal heir has already sold the property by a registered sale deed in favor of a buyer and that buyer is now selling this property to you.So how can DDA re-allot the property in your favor or in favor of your vendor?Don't fall prey to such non maintainable advises.The problem here is that the legal heirs have executed an unregistered relinquishment deed, hence the title to the seller is defective.Your vendor did not bother about the legality of the issue while he purchased the property hence his title is also defective due to the said reason.Now it is seen that it will not be possible for your vendor to gather all the legal heirs and get a ratification deed relinquishing their rights by a registered document.Hence it is advisable that you keep away from this property, demand the vendor to return the booking amount with interest because he failed to produce the valid and substantial documents pertaining to the property.Indemnity bond will not hold in the event of any dispute and the bank also will not grant loan on the basis of the indemnity bondT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Property rights of daughters in the presence of unregistered will in Karnataka",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court ruling in 2020, daughters have equal rights as sons in the ancestral property of their father, even if he died before the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 came into force. However, this ruling applies only to coparcenary property, which is the property inherited by a Hindu male from his father, grandfather or great-grandfather. Self-acquired property, which is the property acquired by a Hindu male by his own efforts or resources, is not coparcenary property and does not fall under the ambit of this ruling.In your case, since your father’s property in Jayanagar, Bangalore was his self-acquired property and not ancestral property, the Supreme Court ruling does not affect your sisters’ rights to it. Your father had the absolute right to dispose of his self-acquired property by a will according to his wishes. Therefore, your sisters do not have any legal claim to the property as per the will made by your father in 1995.However, this does not mean that your sisters cannot challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They can file a suit for declaration and cancellation of the will on various grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, forgery, lack of testamentary capacity or intention, improper execution or attestation, revocation or alteration of the will etc. If they choose to do so, you and your brothers will have to defend the will and prove its genuineness and validity. You will also have to seek legal representation from a lawyer who specializes in property and succession matters.Given this scenario, it is advisable to obtain probate of the will from a competent court. Probate is a legal process that verifies and certifies the authenticity and validity of a will under the seal of the court. Probate can be granted only to the executor appointed by the will or his legal representative. In your case, since you are one of the executors named in the will, you can apply for probate along with your brothers. The process of obtaining probate involves filing a petition in the court along with the original will and other documents such as death certificate of the testator, consent letters from other executors or beneficiaries, affidavit of witnesses etc. The court will issue notices to all the legal heirs of the testator and also publish a citation in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have an interest in the estate. If there are no objections or if they are dismissed by the court, the court will grant probate after verifying the documents and evidence. The probate will act as conclusive proof of the validity of the will and prevent any future disputes or litigation over the property.Without going to court, another option is to mediate this matter through a lawyer or an arbitrator who can help you and your sisters reach an amicable settlement. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process where a neutral third party facilitates communication and negotiation between the parties and helps them resolve their differences without imposing any decision on them. Mediation can save time, money and emotional stress involved in litigation and also preserve family harmony. However, mediation requires consent and cooperation from all the parties involved. If any party is unwilling or unable to participate in mediation or if mediation fails to produce a satisfactory outcome, then litigation may be inevitable.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSupreme Court Ruling on Property Rights of Daughters:The Supreme Court of India ruled that daughters have equal rights in ancestral property. However, your situation involves self-acquired property and a will executed by your father, which allocates the property to his sons. Generally, self-acquired property can be disposed of by the owner as per their wishes through a valid will.a. If the will clearly allocates the property to his sons, it may not be subject to the 2020 Supreme Court ruling on daughters' rights in ancestral property. However, legal interpretations can vary, and your sisters may choose to contest this in court.b. If your sisters contest the will, it's advisable for the brothers to seek legal representation to protect their interests and defend the validity of the will.Probate of Will:In India, the probate of a will is not mandatory but can be beneficial for establishing the validity of the will. Whether it is recommended depends on various factors, including local laws and the circumstances surrounding the will.a. Any interested party can initiate the probate process. Typically, the executor mentioned in the will or one of the beneficiaries does this.b. The outcome of the probate process depends on whether the court finds the will valid. If the will is found valid, it will be legally recognized and can be executed according to its terms.Mediation or Arbitration:Mediation or arbitration can be an alternative to litigation if all parties involved are willing to negotiate and reach a settlement. It's a less adversarial approach and can save time and costs.a. Yes, mediation through a qualified mediator or arbitrator is an option. However, all parties must agree to participate in the process.b. I cannot recommend specific mediators or arbitrators in Bangalore.

    "question": "Can notarized relinquishment deed be used to challenge conveyance deed?",
    "answer": "Buying a property in Delhi can be a complex and risky process, especially when it involves inherited properties and unregistered deeds.First of all, let me explain what a notarized relinquishment deed and a conveyance deed are, and how they differ from each other. A notarized relinquishment deed is a document in which one or more legal heirs of an inherited property give up or release their rights in the property in favour of another legal heir or co-owner. A notarized relinquishment deed is not registered with the sub-registrar’s office and does not have any stamp duty or registration fee. A conveyance deed, on the other hand, is a document in which the owner of a property transfers the title, ownership and rights in the property to another person, usually for a monetary consideration. A conveyance deed is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has stamp duty and registration fee as per the state law.A notarized relinquishment deed is not valid for transferring rights in immovable property in India. Only a registered deed can legally do so. Hence, a notarized relinquishment deed is non-existent in law and has no effect on the ownership of the property. A conveyance deed, however, is valid and binding for transferring rights in immovable property in India. A conveyance deed is also necessary for obtaining mutation of property, which is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records of the government.Based on this, it seems that the previous owner of the property you are planning to buy had obtained a valid conveyance deed from DDA in 1998 based on a notarized relinquishment deed from eight legal heirs of his father. However, since the notarized relinquishment deed was not registered and had no legal effect, it is possible that some or all of those legal heirs may challenge the conveyance deed and claim their rights in the property at any time. This may create a dispute over the title and ownership of the property and affect your rights as a buyer.Therefore, as a cautious buyer, you should not go ahead with the purchase without verifying the authenticity and validity of the notarized relinquishment deed and the conveyance deed. You should also check if there are any other legal heirs who have not given up their rights in the property or if there are any pending cases or disputes over the property. You should also obtain a mutation letter from DDA to confirm that the name of the present owner is recorded in their records as the owner of the property. You should also ensure that all other documents required for mutation of property are in order, such as copy of sale deed, indemnity bond, affidavit, receipt of up-to-date property tax payment, etc.If you buy the property without verifying these documents and issues, you may face problems when you sell the property in future or if any legal heir challenges your ownership. You may also have to pay additional stamp duty and registration fee if you have to execute a fresh conveyance deed or rectify any defects in the existing one. You may also have to face legal hassles and expenses if you have to defend your title and ownership in court.Therefore, my suggestion is that you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law and get his or her opinion on whether it is safe and advisable to buy this property or not. You should also do your own due diligence and research on the history and status of the property before making any decision. I hope this information helps you understand some of the legal aspects of your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRelinquishment Deed: A notarized relinquishment deed, even if not registered, can still hold some legal value. However, a registered relinquishment deed is generally considered more secure and legally binding. It's advisable to try to get the relinquishment deed registered if possible. This can help avoid disputes in the future.Conveyance Deed: The conveyance deed executed and registered by DDA in 1998 is a crucial document that establishes the transfer of ownership from the previous owner to the present owner. Ensure that you have a clear and legally valid copy of this deed.Mutation Letter: The mutation letter is essential for updating the property records with the municipal authority to reflect the current ownership. It is an administrative process, but it's important to ensure that it accurately reflects your ownership.Challenge by Legal Heirs: In India, legal heirs do have the right to challenge property transactions, especially if they believe that their rightful share was not duly considered. However, the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation should provide strong legal proof of ownership. Generally, the limitation period for challenging such transactions is 12 years from the date of knowledge, but it can vary based on specific circumstances and legal interpretations.Cautious Approach: To minimize future risks, it's advisable to consult a local property lawyer who can conduct a thorough due diligence check on the property's title and advise you on any potential issues. They can also guide you on whether additional steps, such as obtaining a registered relinquishment deed, are necessary for added security.Selling the Property: When you plan to sell the property in the future, having all the necessary legal documents in order, including the 1998 conveyance deed and mutation records, should help facilitate a smooth sale. However, it's always wise to consult with a lawyer during the selling process to ensure compliance with all legal requirementsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property rights of daughters in the presence of unregistered will in Karnataka",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court ruling in 2020, daughters have equal rights as sons in the ancestral property of their father, even if he died before the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 came into force. However, this ruling applies only to coparcenary property, which is the property inherited by a Hindu male from his father, grandfather or great-grandfather. Self-acquired property, which is the property acquired by a Hindu male by his own efforts or resources, is not coparcenary property and does not fall under the ambit of this ruling.In your case, since your father’s property in Jayanagar, Bangalore was his self-acquired property and not ancestral property, the Supreme Court ruling does not affect your sisters’ rights to it. Your father had the absolute right to dispose of his self-acquired property by a will according to his wishes. Therefore, your sisters do not have any legal claim to the property as per the will made by your father in 1995.However, this does not mean that your sisters cannot challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They can file a suit for declaration and cancellation of the will on various grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, forgery, lack of testamentary capacity or intention, improper execution or attestation, revocation or alteration of the will etc. If they choose to do so, you and your brothers will have to defend the will and prove its genuineness and validity. You will also have to seek legal representation from a lawyer who specializes in property and succession matters.Given this scenario, it is advisable to obtain probate of the will from a competent court. Probate is a legal process that verifies and certifies the authenticity and validity of a will under the seal of the court. Probate can be granted only to the executor appointed by the will or his legal representative. In your case, since you are one of the executors named in the will, you can apply for probate along with your brothers. The process of obtaining probate involves filing a petition in the court along with the original will and other documents such as death certificate of the testator, consent letters from other executors or beneficiaries, affidavit of witnesses etc. The court will issue notices to all the legal heirs of the testator and also publish a citation in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have an interest in the estate. If there are no objections or if they are dismissed by the court, the court will grant probate after verifying the documents and evidence. The probate will act as conclusive proof of the validity of the will and prevent any future disputes or litigation over the property.Without going to court, another option is to mediate this matter through a lawyer or an arbitrator who can help you and your sisters reach an amicable settlement. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process where a neutral third party facilitates communication and negotiation between the parties and helps them resolve their differences without imposing any decision on them. Mediation can save time, money and emotional stress involved in litigation and also preserve family harmony. However, mediation requires consent and cooperation from all the parties involved. If any party is unwilling or unable to participate in mediation or if mediation fails to produce a satisfactory outcome, then litigation may be inevitable.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSupreme Court Ruling on Property Rights of Daughters:The Supreme Court of India ruled that daughters have equal rights in ancestral property. However, your situation involves self-acquired property and a will executed by your father, which allocates the property to his sons. Generally, self-acquired property can be disposed of by the owner as per their wishes through a valid will.a.

Whether it is recommended depends on various factors, including local laws and the circumstances surrounding the will.a. Any interested party can initiate the probate process. Typically, the executor mentioned in the will or one of the beneficiaries does this.b. The outcome of the probate process depends on whether the court finds the will valid. If the will is found valid, it will be legally recognized and can be executed according to its terms.Mediation or Arbitration:Mediation or arbitration can be an alternative to litigation if all parties involved are willing to negotiate and reach a settlement. It's a less adversarial approach and can save time and costs.a. Yes, mediation through a qualified mediator or arbitrator is an option. However, all parties must agree to participate in the process.b. I cannot recommend specific mediators or arbitrators in Bangalore. You may need to research and consult with legal professionals or organizations that offer mediation services to find a suitable mediator.Regarding the approximate charges for legal services, it varies widely depending on the complexity of the case, the location, and the lawyer's fees.

The association can work on creating parking rules and demarcating spaces.Negotiate Amicably: Try to have a polite and reasonable conversation with the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat and the local politician. Explain the situation, share your agreement with the builder, and ask them to cooperate in resolving the issue peacefully.Document Everything: Keep records of all communications, including emails, messages, and any written agreements or documents related to the parking space.Mediation: If a direct negotiation doesn't work, consider mediation. A neutral third party can help facilitate a discussion between you and the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat to reach a resolution.Police Complaint: If all else fails, and you believe your rights are being violated, you can file a complaint with the local police station. Present your evidence, including the builder's agreement, and explain the situation. The police may intervene to ensure that your rights are protected.Legal Action: If none of the above steps yield results, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a civil lawsuit. Your attorney can guide you through this process, which can be complex and time-consuming.Remember that property disputes can be complicated and can take time to resolve. Consult with a qualified attorney to understand your specific legal rights and options in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Related to car park in an unregistered apartment building",
    "answer": "According to the Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, the car parking space in an apartment building is a part of the common areas and facilities, which are owned by all the apartment owners in proportion to their respective shares. The car parking space cannot be sold or transferred separately by the builder or any apartment owner. The association of apartment owners has the power to regulate the use and maintenance of the common areas and facilities, including the car parking space.Therefore, if you want to recover your car parking space, you should try to do the following:Check your sale deed and other documents that you have received from the previous flat owner or the builder. See if there is any mention of the car parking space allotted to you or any clause that gives you equal rights in the parking and common areas. If there is, then you have a legal basis to claim your parking space.Talk to the other flat owners who have been allotted car parking spaces and see if they are willing to support you. You can also try to negotiate with the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner and explain to them that you have a right to park your car as per your agreement with the builder. You can also offer to exchange your parking space with another vacant one or pay a reasonable fee for using it.If talking and negotiating does not work, then you can approach the association of apartment owners and file a complaint against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner. You can request the association to intervene and resolve the dispute amicably. You can also ask them to frame clear rules and regulations for the allocation and use of car parking spaces in the building.If the association of apartment owners is not registered or does not exist, then you can try to form one with the consent of at least 60% of the flat owners in the building. You can then register the association under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other applicable law. You can then elect a managing committee and frame bye-laws for the administration of the building, including the car parking space.If none of these steps work, then you can file a complaint with the nearest police station against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner for illegally occupying your parking space and harassing you. You can also file a civil suit in the court for injunction and declaration of your right to park your car in your allotted space. You will need a lawyer to help you with these legal actions.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Property rights of daughters in the presence of unregistered will in Karnataka",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court ruling in 2020, daughters have equal rights as sons in the ancestral property of their father, even if he died before the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 came into force. However, this ruling applies only to coparcenary property, which is the property inherited by a Hindu male from his father, grandfather or great-grandfather. Self-acquired property, which is the property acquired by a Hindu male by his own efforts or resources, is not coparcenary property and does not fall under the ambit of this ruling.In your case, since your father’s property in Jayanagar, Bangalore was his self-acquired property and not ancestral property, the Supreme Court ruling does not affect your sisters’ rights to it. Your father had the absolute right to dispose of his self-acquired property by a will according to his wishes. Therefore, your sisters do not have any legal claim to the property as per the will made by your father in 1995.However, this does not mean that your sisters cannot challenge the validity of the will in a court of law. They can file a suit for declaration and cancellation of the will on various grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, forgery, lack of testamentary capacity or intention, improper execution or attestation, revocation or alteration of the will etc. If they choose to do so, you and your brothers will have to defend the will and prove its genuineness and validity. You will also have to seek legal representation from a lawyer who specializes in property and succession matters.Given this scenario, it is advisable to obtain probate of the will from a competent court. Probate is a legal process that verifies and certifies the authenticity and validity of a will under the seal of the court. Probate can be granted only to the executor appointed by the will or his legal representative. In your case, since you are one of the executors named in the will, you can apply for probate along with your brothers. The process of obtaining probate involves filing a petition in the court along with the original will and other documents such as death certificate of the testator, consent letters from other executors or beneficiaries, affidavit of witnesses etc. The court will issue notices to all the legal heirs of the testator and also publish a citation in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have an interest in the estate. If there are no objections or if they are dismissed by the court, the court will grant probate after verifying the documents and evidence. The probate will act as conclusive proof of the validity of the will and prevent any future disputes or litigation over the property.Without going to court, another option is to mediate this matter through a lawyer or an arbitrator who can help you and your sisters reach an amicable settlement. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process where a neutral third party facilitates communication and negotiation between the parties and helps them resolve their differences without imposing any decision on them. Mediation can save time, money and emotional stress involved in litigation and also preserve family harmony. However, mediation requires consent and cooperation from all the parties involved. If any party is unwilling or unable to participate in mediation or if mediation fails to produce a satisfactory outcome, then litigation may be inevitable.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSupreme Court Ruling on Property Rights of Daughters:The Supreme Court of India ruled that daughters have equal rights in ancestral property. However, your situation involves self-acquired property and a will executed by your father, which allocates the property to his sons. Generally, self-acquired property can be disposed of by the owner as per their wishes through a valid will.a. If the will clearly allocates the property to his sons, it may not be subject to the 2020 Supreme Court ruling on daughters' rights in ancestral property. However, legal interpretations can vary, and your sisters may choose to contest this in court.b. If your sisters contest the will, it's advisable for the brothers to seek legal representation to protect their interests and defend the validity of the will.Probate of Will:In India, the probate of a will is not mandatory but can be beneficial for establishing the validity of the will. Whether it is recommended depends on various factors, including local laws and the circumstances surrounding the will.a. Any interested party can initiate the probate process. Typically, the executor mentioned in the will or one of the beneficiaries does this.b. The outcome of the probate process depends on whether the court finds the will valid. If the will is found valid, it will be legally recognized and can be executed according to its terms.Mediation or Arbitration:Mediation or arbitration can be an alternative to litigation if all parties involved are willing to negotiate and reach a settlement. It's a less adversarial approach and can save time and costs.a. Yes, mediation through a qualified mediator or arbitrator is an option. However, all parties must agree to participate in the process.b. I cannot recommend specific mediators or arbitrators in Bangalore. You may need to research and consult with legal professionals or organizations that offer mediation services to find a suitable mediator.Regarding the approximate charges for legal services, it varies widely depending on the complexity of the case, the location, and the lawyer's fees.

    "question": "Rights of women's children in mother's father's ancestral property after she receives compensation",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property rights and partition are governed by various laws and regulations, primarily theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and other personal laws applicable to different religious communities.Based on the information provided, here are some general points to consider:Compromise Agreement: If a woman files a partition suit on her father's ancestral property and enters into a compromise agreement with her father and his sons from the second wife (where the first wife is also a party to the compromise), this agreement is legally binding. The terms of the compromise agreement will dictate how the property is divided, whether it is through a monetary settlement or otherwise.Children's Rights: If the woman has adult children who were not parties to the compromise agreement, they may have a claim to the ancestral property or its proceeds, depending on the specific terms of the compromise agreement and the applicable laws.Legal Rights of Children: Under Indian law, children, whether minor or adult, may have a legal right to the ancestral property of their father. If they were not part of the compromise agreement, their rights may not have been extinguished.Partition of Ancestral Property: Ancestral property rights are governed by specific rules and laws. Generally, ancestral property can be partitioned among the legal heirs, and such partition should ideally include all the legal heirs, which may include the children of the woman.Challenging the Compromise: If the children believe that their rights to the ancestral property were not adequately protected or considered in the compromise agreement, they may have the option to challenge the agreement in court. However, the success of such a challenge would depend on the specific circumstances and legal arguments presented.Legal Counsel: It is highly advisable for the children to consult with a qualified attorney in India who specializes in property and family law. An attorney can review the specifics of the compromise agreement, assess the children's rights, and provide guidance on the best course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Grounds for quashing may include the absence of any prima facie case, abuse of process, or a case devoid of merit. The court may quash the proceedings if it finds that the case is maliciously filed or an abuse of the legal process.Stay Order:You can also approach the High Court to seek a stay order on the DV case proceedings until the matter is resolved through the quashing petition. The court may grant a stay order if it believes that there are valid reasons to halt the lower court proceedings until the High Court makes a decision on your quashing petition.Defending the Case:Simultaneously, you should engage a skilled lawyer to defend you in the DV case. Your lawyer can present evidence, including the photograph of all four of you at the airport, to establish that you were not present at the alleged time and date of the incident. Your lawyer can also cross-examine witnesses and present other evidence to prove the falsity of the complaint.Mediation:You may consider mediation as an option to resolve the dispute amicably, but this depends on the willingness of both parties to participate.It's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney in India who can review your specific case details and guide you through the legal process.

    "answer": "Dear ClientSetting up a company involves several legal and administrative steps. Here are some legal remedies and considerations for starting your e-commerce business with multiple brands under it:Required Paperwork and Costs:a. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): If you plan to share proprietary information with third-party manufacturers, it's advisable to have them sign an NDA to protect your intellectual property. Legal costs for drafting an NDA can vary but are typically reasonable.b. GST Registration: If your annual turnover is expected to exceed the prescribed threshold (which varies by country), you may need to register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) or its equivalent. The cost for GST registration can vary depending on your location.c. CIN (Company Identification Number): If you choose to register your company as a Private Limited Company or Limited Company, you'll receive a Corporate Identification Number (CIN). The cost of incorporating such companies can vary but is usually higher compared to other business structures.d. Trademark Registration: To protect your brand names and logos, it's advisable to register trademarks. The costs for trademark registration vary based on the number of classes you register under and the region/country in which you seek protection.Choice of Business Structure:You mentioned considering Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or One Person Company (OPC). The choice of business structure should be based on various factors, including your long-term business goals, tax implications, and liability. Here are some points to consider:LLP: Provides limited liability for partners and is relatively easier to set up compared to a Private Limited Company. Tax implications can be favorable, as LLPs are often taxed similarly to partnerships. Annual compliance costs are generally lower compared to companies.OPC: Suitable if you want to operate as a single owner. OPCs also offer limited liability. Tax implications depend on your income and may be similar to those of sole proprietorships or individual taxation.Consult with a chartered accountant (CA) or tax consultant to assess the tax implications based on your specific circumstances.Annual Maintenance Expense:The annual maintenance expenses for a company can vary depending on its structure, size, and compliance requirements. Generally, an LLP has lower annual compliance costs compared to a Private Limited Company. Expect to incur expenses related to accounting, annual filings, audits, and other statutory compliance requirements. Consulting a CA can help estimate these costs more accurately.Choosing a Professional:Chartered Accountant (CA): CAs specialize in taxation, financial planning, and compliance. They can assist with GST registration, tax planning, and financial matters.Corporate Lawyer: Corporate lawyers specialize in legal aspects of business, including drafting contracts, agreements, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They can help with drafting NDAs, shareholder agreements, and other legal documents.Attorney: An attorney can provide legal advice and draft legal documents, but their expertise may vary depending on their specialization.It's often advisable to consult both a CA and a corporate lawyer to cover both financial and legal aspects of your business. They can provide comprehensive guidance on the setup and ongoing compliance requirements of your company.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Consult a Legal Expert: It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and real estate matters. They can provide you with specific advice based on the laws and regulations in Chennai, which may vary.Review the Builder's Agreement: Since the builder's agreement mentions \"equal rights in the parking and common areas,\" this can be a crucial piece of evidence to support your claim to the parking space.Association Formation: You mentioned that the owners have not registered an association. Encourage the flat owners to establish a residents' association. Having a formal association can help in managing common issues like parking disputes. The association can work on creating parking rules and demarcating spaces.Negotiate Amicably: Try to have a polite and reasonable conversation with the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat and the local politician. Explain the situation, share your agreement with the builder, and ask them to cooperate in resolving the issue peacefully.Document Everything: Keep records of all communications, including emails, messages, and any written agreements or documents related to the parking space.Mediation: If a direct negotiation doesn't work, consider mediation. A neutral third party can help facilitate a discussion between you and the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat to reach a resolution.Police Complaint: If all else fails, and you believe your rights are being violated, you can file a complaint with the local police station. Present your evidence, including the builder's agreement, and explain the situation. The police may intervene to ensure that your rights are protected.Legal Action: If none of the above steps yield results, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a civil lawsuit. Your attorney can guide you through this process, which can be complex and time-consuming.Remember that property disputes can be complicated and can take time to resolve.

    "question": "Related to car park in an unregistered apartment building",
    "answer": "According to the Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, the car parking space in an apartment building is a part of the common areas and facilities, which are owned by all the apartment owners in proportion to their respective shares. The car parking space cannot be sold or transferred separately by the builder or any apartment owner. The association of apartment owners has the power to regulate the use and maintenance of the common areas and facilities, including the car parking space.Therefore, if you want to recover your car parking space, you should try to do the following:Check your sale deed and other documents that you have received from the previous flat owner or the builder. See if there is any mention of the car parking space allotted to you or any clause that gives you equal rights in the parking and common areas. If there is, then you have a legal basis to claim your parking space.Talk to the other flat owners who have been allotted car parking spaces and see if they are willing to support you. You can also try to negotiate with the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner and explain to them that you have a right to park your car as per your agreement with the builder. You can also offer to exchange your parking space with another vacant one or pay a reasonable fee for using it.If talking and negotiating does not work, then you can approach the association of apartment owners and file a complaint against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner. You can request the association to intervene and resolve the dispute amicably. You can also ask them to frame clear rules and regulations for the allocation and use of car parking spaces in the building.If the association of apartment owners is not registered or does not exist, then you can try to form one with the consent of at least 60% of the flat owners in the building. You can then register the association under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other applicable law.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, property rights and partition are governed by various laws and regulations, primarily theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and other personal laws applicable to different religious communities.Based on the information provided, here are some general points to consider:Compromise Agreement: If a woman files a partition suit on her father's ancestral property and enters into a compromise agreement with her father and his sons from the second wife (where the first wife is also a party to the compromise), this agreement is legally binding. The terms of the compromise agreement will dictate how the property is divided, whether it is through a monetary settlement or otherwise.Children's Rights: If the woman has adult children who were not parties to the compromise agreement, they may have a claim to the ancestral property or its proceeds, depending on the specific terms of the compromise agreement and the applicable laws.Legal Rights of Children: Under Indian law, children, whether minor or adult, may have a legal right to the ancestral property of their father. If they were not part of the compromise agreement, their rights may not have been extinguished.Partition of Ancestral Property: Ancestral property rights are governed by specific rules and laws. Generally, ancestral property can be partitioned among the legal heirs, and such partition should ideally include all the legal heirs, which may include the children of the woman.Challenging the Compromise: If the children believe that their rights to the ancestral property were not adequately protected or considered in the compromise agreement, they may have the option to challenge the agreement in court.

So to determine that question it can also return a finding as regards the LA award being fraudulent or not. The LA award relates to a dispute raised in the execution proceedings and nothing stops the execution court from deciding thatAs the LA award was obtained fraudulently it is non est in the eyes of law and does not affect the decree at all and as per the dictum of the SC such a fraud vitiates all acts, ecclesiastical as well as temporal or even a judicial act. In your case fraud was practiced on the LA and the award was obtained.The JD cannot bypass the procedure of filing an appeal by securing a fraudulent LA award. Though the JD had filed the appeal but that appeal was not decided on merits and was referred to the lok adalat where it came to be disposed of by virtue of the fraudulent LA award. So the court never got an opportunity to apply its mind as regards the grounds of challenge raised in the appeal.

The Supreme Court further observed that if the signatures of the Plaintiff.It is settled law thatexecuting court cannot go beyond the decree.it must take the decree as it stands, for the decree is binding and conclusive between the parties to the suit”.But the difficulty arises when there is ambiguity in the decree with regard to the material aspects. Then it becomes the bounden duty of the court to interpret the decree in the process of giving a true effect to the decree. At that juncture the executing court has to be very cautious in supplementing its interpretation and conscious of the fact that it cannot draw a new decree. The executing court shall strike a fine balance between the two while exercising this jurisdiction in the processof giving effect to the decree.However in yor case, if the executing court is taking any decision against your petition, then you may prefer an appeal against the lok adalat decree stating that the opponent played fraud  hence the same is null and void  and the same court has powers to rectify the decree due to the fraud played on it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Consult a Legal Expert: It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and real estate matters. They can provide you with specific advice based on the laws and regulations in Chennai, which may vary.Review the Builder's Agreement: Since the builder's agreement mentions \"equal rights in the parking and common areas,\" this can be a crucial piece of evidence to support your claim to the parking space.Association Formation: You mentioned that the owners have not registered an association. Encourage the flat owners to establish a residents' association. Having a formal association can help in managing common issues like parking disputes. The association can work on creating parking rules and demarcating spaces.Negotiate Amicably: Try to have a polite and reasonable conversation with the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat and the local politician. Explain the situation, share your agreement with the builder, and ask them to cooperate in resolving the issue peacefully.Document Everything: Keep records of all communications, including emails, messages, and any written agreements or documents related to the parking space.Mediation: If a direct negotiation doesn't work, consider mediation. A neutral third party can help facilitate a discussion between you and the owner of the 620 sq.ft flat to reach a resolution.Police Complaint: If all else fails, and you believe your rights are being violated, you can file a complaint with the local police station. Present your evidence, including the builder's agreement, and explain the situation. The police may intervene to ensure that your rights are protected.Legal Action: If none of the above steps yield results, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a civil lawsuit. Your attorney can guide you through this process, which can be complex and time-consuming.Remember that property disputes can be complicated and can take time to resolve. Consult with a qualified attorney to understand your specific legal rights and options in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Related to car park in an unregistered apartment building",
    "answer": "According to the Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, the car parking space in an apartment building is a part of the common areas and facilities, which are owned by all the apartment owners in proportion to their respective shares. The car parking space cannot be sold or transferred separately by the builder or any apartment owner. The association of apartment owners has the power to regulate the use and maintenance of the common areas and facilities, including the car parking space.Therefore, if you want to recover your car parking space, you should try to do the following:Check your sale deed and other documents that you have received from the previous flat owner or the builder. See if there is any mention of the car parking space allotted to you or any clause that gives you equal rights in the parking and common areas. If there is, then you have a legal basis to claim your parking space.Talk to the other flat owners who have been allotted car parking spaces and see if they are willing to support you. You can also try to negotiate with the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner and explain to them that you have a right to park your car as per your agreement with the builder. You can also offer to exchange your parking space with another vacant one or pay a reasonable fee for using it.If talking and negotiating does not work, then you can approach the association of apartment owners and file a complaint against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner. You can request the association to intervene and resolve the dispute amicably. You can also ask them to frame clear rules and regulations for the allocation and use of car parking spaces in the building.If the association of apartment owners is not registered or does not exist, then you can try to form one with the consent of at least 60% of the flat owners in the building. You can then register the association under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other applicable law. You can then elect a managing committee and frame bye-laws for the administration of the building, including the car parking space.If none of these steps work, then you can file a complaint with the nearest police station against the offending flat owner and the politician flat owner for illegally occupying your parking space and harassing you.

Your lawyer can also cross-examine witnesses and present other evidence to prove the falsity of the complaint.Mediation:You may consider mediation as an option to resolve the dispute amicably, but this depends on the willingness of both parties to participate.It's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney in India who can review your specific case details and guide you through the legal process. They will be able to assess the strength of your case and advise you on the best course of actionAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "New business setup paperwork needed with cost",
    "answer": "Dear ClientSetting up a company involves several legal and administrative steps. Here are some legal remedies and considerations for starting your e-commerce business with multiple brands under it:Required Paperwork and Costs:a. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): If you plan to share proprietary information with third-party manufacturers, it's advisable to have them sign an NDA to protect your intellectual property. Legal costs for drafting an NDA can vary but are typically reasonable.b. GST Registration: If your annual turnover is expected to exceed the prescribed threshold (which varies by country), you may need to register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) or its equivalent. The cost for GST registration can vary depending on your location.c. CIN (Company Identification Number): If you choose to register your company as a Private Limited Company or Limited Company, you'll receive a Corporate Identification Number (CIN). The cost of incorporating such companies can vary but is usually higher compared to other business structures.d. Trademark Registration: To protect your brand names and logos, it's advisable to register trademarks. The costs for trademark registration vary based on the number of classes you register under and the region/country in which you seek protection.Choice of Business Structure:You mentioned considering Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or One Person Company (OPC). The choice of business structure should be based on various factors, including your long-term business goals, tax implications, and liability. Here are some points to consider:LLP: Provides limited liability for partners and is relatively easier to set up compared to a Private Limited Company. Tax implications can be favorable, as LLPs are often taxed similarly to partnerships. Annual compliance costs are generally lower compared to companies.OPC: Suitable if you want to operate as a single owner. OPCs also offer limited liability. Tax implications depend on your income and may be similar to those of sole proprietorships or individual taxation.Consult with a chartered accountant (CA) or tax consultant to assess the tax implications based on your specific circumstances.Annual Maintenance Expense:The annual maintenance expenses for a company can vary depending on its structure, size, and compliance requirements. Generally, an LLP has lower annual compliance costs compared to a Private Limited Company. Expect to incur expenses related to accounting, annual filings, audits, and other statutory compliance requirements. Consulting a CA can help estimate these costs more accurately.Choosing a Professional:Chartered Accountant (CA): CAs specialize in taxation, financial planning, and compliance. They can assist with GST registration, tax planning, and financial matters.Corporate Lawyer: Corporate lawyers specialize in legal aspects of business, including drafting contracts, agreements, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They can help with drafting NDAs, shareholder agreements, and other legal documents.Attorney: An attorney can provide legal advice and draft legal documents, but their expertise may vary depending on their specialization.It's often advisable to consult both a CA and a corporate lawyer to cover both financial and legal aspects of your business. They can provide comprehensive guidance on the setup and ongoing compliance requirements of your company.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Telling the DH to go and file a separate suit to set aside the LA award obtained by fraud by JD with the imposter Plaintiff, amounts to multiplicity of litigationCourts are against multiplying litigation and work to end the litigationThe s. 47 EC court has wide powers to go into the aspect whether or not the decree is executable. So to determine that question it can also return a finding as regards the LA award being fraudulent or not. The LA award relates to a dispute raised in the execution proceedings and nothing stops the execution court from deciding thatAs the LA award was obtained fraudulently it is non est in the eyes of law and does not affect the decree at all and as per the dictum of the SC such a fraud vitiates all acts, ecclesiastical as well as temporal or even a judicial act. In your case fraud was practiced on the LA and the award was obtained.The JD cannot bypass the procedure of filing an appeal by securing a fraudulent LA award. Though the JD had filed the appeal but that appeal was not decided on merits and was referred to the lok adalat where it came to be disposed of by virtue of the fraudulent LA award. So the court never got an opportunity to apply its mind as regards the grounds of challenge raised in the appeal. The JD cannot bypass that and now rely on the LA award to contend that the decree is not executableYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "The award of Lok Adalat cannot be reversed or set aside without setting aside the facts recorded in such award as fraudulent arrived at. The Supreme Court further observed that if the signatures of the Plaintiff.It is settled law thatexecuting court cannot go beyond the decree.it must take the decree as it stands, for the decree is binding and conclusive between the parties to the suit”.But the difficulty arises when there is ambiguity in the decree with regard to the material aspects. Then it becomes the bounden duty of the court to interpret the decree in the process of giving a true effect to the decree. At that juncture the executing court has to be very cautious in supplementing its interpretation and conscious of the fact that it cannot draw a new decree. The executing court shall strike a fine balance between the two while exercising this jurisdiction in the processof giving effect to the decree.However in yor case, if the executing court is taking any decision against your petition, then you may prefer an appeal against the lok adalat decree stating that the opponent played fraud  hence the same is null and void  and the same court has powers to rectify the decree due to the fraud played on it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientCompromise Decree: The compromise decree issued by the Bangalore magistrate court in 2001 is a legally binding document. It specified that D agreed to accept 4 lakhs in cash instead of the 8 lakhs initially sought. The court also ordered the land to be registered within 15 days.Non-Registration of Land: Since the land was not registered as per the court order within 15 days, there may be issues related to the compliance with the court's decree.Subdivision and Sale: The subdivision of the land into multiple plots and the subsequent sale of those plots to various individuals, including Party E, could potentially raise legal issues. The sale deeds mentioning the case number from the lawsuit may indicate that there is a legal dispute associated with the land.Property Taxes: Party E has been paying property taxes since 2001. This may establish their possession or claim to the property, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal complexities arising from the compromise decree and the subsequent sale of the land.Party F's Purchase: If Party F is interested in buying the land from Party E, they should conduct thorough due diligence, including a title search and verification of all legal documents associated with the property. This will help identify any potential legal issues or encumbrances on the land.Potential Issues: There are several potential issues that could arise in the future, including challenges related to the validity of the compromise decree, the court's order for land registration, and the subdivision and sale of the land without proper registration. Party F should be aware of these potential issues and seek legal advice to assess the risks involved.It's crucial for Party F to consult with a qualified property lawyer in India who can review all relevant documents, assess the legal status of the land, and provide guidance on whether it is advisable to proceed with the purchase. Resolving these legal complexities may require further legal action or negotiations with the parties involved in the original lawsuit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
