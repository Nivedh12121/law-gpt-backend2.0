    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the person who caused the damage to your brother’s car is liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of the accident. Section 140 of the Act deals with the principle of ‘no-fault liability’, which means that the owners of motor vehicles are liable to pay for the compensation of the victims of accidents caused by them, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. Section 163A of the Act provides for a structured formula for calculating the compensation amount based on various factors, such as age, income, disability, etc.Therefore, your brother has the right to claim compensation from the person who was driving the Innova that hit his car from behind. He can file a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Goa, where the accident took place or where he resides. He can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Goa, if he is eligible for it. He will have to submit relevant documents and evidence to prove his claim, such as FIR, medical reports, photographs, witnesses, etc. The MACT will then decide the amount of compensation after hearing both parties and examining the evidence.If your brother was badly injured in the accident, he can also claim compensation for his personal injury and medical expenses. He can also file a criminal case against the person who was driving the Innova for rash and negligent driving under Section 279 and 337 of theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These sections provide for imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs. 1000 or both. However, filing a criminal case may take longer and involve more procedures than filing a civil claim.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Car hit In my vehicle causing my car major damage",
    "answer": "Dear client,In many jurisdictions, if someone is responsible for a car accident due to their negligence or recklessness, they may be liable for the damages they cause. This typically includes damage to the vehicles involved, medical expenses for injuries, and other related costs. However, the specific rules and regulations can vary by location.In your brother's case, it's important to consider the following steps:Contact Insurance: Even if your brother's car is insured, he should report the accident to his insurance company. They can assess the damage and work on the claim, even if the other driver is at fault.Police Report: Since the police were involved and a report was filed, this can be crucial in establishing the facts of the accident.Consult Legal Advice: If the other driver is not cooperating and your brother believes he is not getting the compensation he deserves, he may want to consult with a personal injury attorney or a lawyer specializing in car accidents. They can advise him on the best course of action based on local laws.Medical Evaluation: If your brother or anyone else involved in the accident sustained injuries, it's essential to seek medical attention. Injuries may not be immediately apparent, so a medical evaluation is important for documenting any health issues related to the accident."

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit. It's best to have a reasonable amount in your bank account to demonstrate financial sufficiency.Remember that visa requirements can change, and it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by the Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine when applying for your visa."

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit. It's best to have a reasonable amount in your bank account to demonstrate financial sufficiency.Remember that visa requirements can change, and it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by the Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine when applying for your visa.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Double passport (India and Canada)",
    "answer": "India does not allow dual citizenship with any other country, as per the Indian Citizenship Act of 1955. It is considered a punishable offence to apply for, continue to hold or obtain an Indian passport after acquiring foreign citizenship. Indian nationals who obtain Canadian citizenship are required to renounce their Indian citizenship and surrender their Indian passport within three months of acquiring foreign citizenship.If your son flies and enters India on his Indian passport without surrendering it, he may face legal or other issues, such as:He may be detained or questioned by the immigration authorities at the airport for travelling on an invalid passport and concealing his Canadian citizenship.He may be fined or penalized for not surrendering his Indian passport within the stipulated time and violating the Indian Passport Act of 1967 and the Foreigners Act of 1946.He may lose his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status or eligibility, which grants certain benefits and privileges to former Indian citizens who have acquired foreign citizenship.He may face difficulties in obtaining an exit permit or a visa to return to Canada, as he will not be able to produce his Canadian passport or proof of citizenship at the Indian authorities.Based on this information, it seems that your son should not fly and enter India on his Indian passport and then surrender it later. He should follow the proper procedure and surrender his Indian passport at the nearest Indian consulate or embassy in Canada before travelling to India. He should also apply for an OCI card or a visa to enter India as a Canadian citizen.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Marrying an American",
    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Does daughter have any right in father's business run by brother after father's death",
    "answer": "You have the right to claim your share in your father’s business, as well as the profits he earned after his death. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, as amended in 2005, daughters have equal rights as sons in their father’s property, whether it is ancestral or self-acquired. Since your father died without a will, his property will be divided equally among his legal heirs, which include you, your brother, and your mother (if she is alive). Therefore, you can file a suit for partition and accounting of the business, and demand your share of the assets and profits. You can also ask for the books of accounts and other documents related to the business, to verify the income and expenditure of the business.However, you will have to file the suit in Imphal, where the business is located and where your brother resides. The jurisdiction of a civil suit is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business. Since both these factors are in Imphal, you cannot file the suit in Delhi. You will have to engage a lawyer in Imphal who can represent you in the court there. You can also seek legal aid from the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority in Imphal, if you are eligible for it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,Inheritance Rights: In the absence of a will, the inheritance laws of the state where your father resided and owned the business would typically apply. These laws determine how your father's assets, including the shoe shop, are distributed among his legal heirs. You and your siblings may have a legitimate claim to a share of the business as his legal heirs.Types of Legal Actions:You can file a suit for partition to claim your rightful share of the business's assets.You may also request an account of the business's financial transactions and profits to assess the value of your share.Location for Filing Suit: The location for filing the suit would generally be in the jurisdiction where the business is located, which, in this case, is Imphal, Manipur. It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Imphal who specializes in property and inheritance law. They can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements for your case.Legal Counsel: It's crucial to seek legal counsel to navigate this situation effectively. A lawyer can help you understand your rights, draft necessary legal documents, and represent your interests in court if required."

    "question": "Whatsapp and Email",
    "answer": "You can pass on your instructions for your divorce case through Whatsapp messages or email, as long as you and your lawyer agree on the terms and conditions of such communication. Whatsapp messages and email are considered as valid evidence in Indian courts, as they fall under the category of electronic records under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, you should also be aware of the risks and challenges of using such modes of communication, such as:The authenticity and integrity of the messages or email may be questioned or challenged by the other party or the court, as they can be easily manipulated, deleted, hacked or forged.The confidentiality and privacy of the messages or email may be compromised or violated by third parties, such as service providers, hackers, spyware, etc.The admissibility and reliability of the messages or email may depend on various factors, such as the source, destination, date, time, signature, encryption, etc., of the communication. You may also need to produce additional evidence or witnesses to corroborate or support your messages or email.Therefore, you should follow some best practices and precautions while communicating with your lawyer through Whatsapp messages or email, such as:You should have a written agreement or contract with your lawyer that specifies the scope, purpose, frequency and mode of communication between you and your lawyer. The agreement should also mention the fees, expenses, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in relation to the communication.You should use a secure and reliable platform or service for sending and receiving messages or email. You should also use strong passwords, encryption, antivirus software and other security measures to protect your devices and accounts from unauthorized access or interference.You should keep a backup or copy of all your messages or email in a safe place. You should also maintain a record of the date, time, sender, receiver and subject of each message or email. You should also avoid deleting or altering any message or email that may be relevant for your case.You should use clear and concise language and avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding in your messages or email. You should also avoid using any abusive, offensive or defamatory language that may harm your reputation or case. You should also respect the professional ethics and etiquette of your lawyer and avoid any unnecessary or excessive communication.The best mode of communication for your situation may depend on your personal preference and convenience. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Whatsapp messages or email are:Whatsapp messages are faster and easier to send and receive than email. They are also more interactive and informal than email. However, Whatsapp messages may not have a legal validity or recognition in some countries or jurisdictions. They may also have a lower quality or resolution than email. They may also be subject to data charges or network issues.Email is more formal and professional than Whatsapp messages. They are also more widely accepted and recognized as legal evidence in most countries or jurisdictions. They can also have a higher quality or resolution than Whatsapp messages. They can also attach documents, images, videos or other files that may be relevant for your case. However, email may be slower and harder to send and receive than Whatsapp messages. They may also be less interactive and more impersonal than Whatsapp messages. They may also be subject to spam filters or storage limits.You can avoid conflicts with your lawyer by communicating with him/her in a respectful, honest and cooperative manner. You should also follow his/her advice and instructions regarding your case. You should also pay his/her fees and expenses on time and in full. You should also inform him/her about any changes or developments in your situation that may affect your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Renting a flat for fiancee",
    "answer": "Renting a property in India as an unmarried couple is legal, but it may depend on the state and local laws, as well as the discretion of the landlord. You should be aware that while renting a property, you must create a rent agreement in the names of both parties and get it duly signed by them to safeguard your rights for the future. The rent agreement should also mention the ratio of the rent amount paid by each party and the mode of payment. You may also need to provide proof of identity and address for both of you, such as passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, etc.If you want to use the rent agreement to update your address on your documents for passport purpose, you should make sure that the agreement is registered with the sub-registrar’s office and has a stamp duty paid on it. A registered rent agreement is a valid proof of address for passport application.Your backup plan of renting the property only under your name but having the full rent amount paid by your American fiancée may not be advisable, as it may raise suspicion from the landlord and the authorities. It may also create problems for you in proving your lawful tenancy and claiming your rights in case of any dispute. It is better to have a joint rent agreement with both of your names and signatures on it.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "An executor of a will can also be a beneficiary of the same will. There is no legal bar for a person to be both an executor and a legatee (a person who inherits under a will) under the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However, it is advisable to appoint an impartial person as an executor who can carry out the wishes of the testator without any conflict of interest or bias.An executor can charge a fee for his services, but only if the will expressly authorizes him to do so. Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The executor has to declare the fee as part of his income and pay tax on it according to his applicable slab rate. The fee is not exempt from tax under any provision of the Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Hence, there is no restriction in one person being named as the executor as well as the beneficiary of a Will.If for any reason, the named executor cannot act as the executor, or does not show an intent to do so, the bequest being made to such person in the capacity of a beneficiary shall not be valid. If you do not wish to include any other relative or friend as an executor of the Will, you may also consider appointing a professional or a lawyer as the executor.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The requirements for canceling services with a lawyer can vary based on your location and the terms outlined in the agreement you have with the lawyer. In many cases, a simple written notice may suffice, but it's often better to follow the specific guidelines outlined in your contract or engagement agreement with the lawyer. Sometimes, contracts stipulate the method or form of cancellation, which might include sending a formal letter or notice. Others might accept an email or a written statement. However, it's crucial to ensure that whatever method you choose meets the legal requirements and the terms of the agreement. If you're unsure about the appropriate method or if your agreement doesn't specify, it's a good idea to reach out to the lawyer or their firm directly to confirm the correct procedure for canceling services. This can prevent any misunderstandings or potential issues down the line.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Insofar as this particular property is concerned, the mother is now the absolute owner with clear and marketable title on her name by the virtue of the registered gift deed through which the property was transferred to her name.2. The alleged generic POA deed is a nominal one without any value or would be considered as legally valid especially if this POA deed is used for transferring the immovable property because there are no particulars or details of the property to be transferred, hence it is void.3. Your vendor should provide you the original gift deed, original sale deed on the name of her donor, the link document in original in respect of the property sold by the vendor to the son2, encumbrance certificate, property tax receipts, mutation records if any, khata and any other relevant documents pertaining to this property.4.

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer. You can also verify these documents from the concerned authorities or offices where they are registered or recorded.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, you would typically need the involvement of the mother (since she is the current owner), Son2 (the original owner), and potentially Son1 if he has been granted power of attorney (GPA) by Son2.Moreover in India general power of attorney is valid. General Power of Attorney (GPA) isa legal document that gives someone the authority to legally act on your behalf in a certain situation. This can be useful if you are unable to make decisions for yourself, or if you need someone to help manage your finances, property, or other important affairsBesides the GPA, you may need other documents like property titles, clearances, and any relevant tax records.Regarding the Will document and Generic GPA, you may have the right to request them, but their disclosure would depend on the willingness of Son2 and Son1 to share these documents.

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval. The possibility of getting back wages and employment upon company revival hinges on feasibility, viability, and worker consent.

    "question": "Typing error in rectification deed",
    "answer": "A rectification deed is a legal instrument that allows you to correct any minor errors or mistakes in your property documents, such as spelling errors, typing errors, mistakes in property description, etc. A rectification deed is also known as a correction deed, confirmation deed, supplementary deed, amendment deed, etc. A rectification deed is recognized under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and has to be registered to become legally valid.In your case, you have found some typing errors in the rectification deed that was done to correct the measurement of the property in the gift deed. The errors are related to the date and the unit of measurement. These errors can be rectified by executing another rectification deed with the consent of all the parties involved in the original deed. The second rectification deed should clearly mention the errors and the corrections made in the first rectification deed and refer to the registration number and date of the first rectification deed. The second rectification deed should also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable.Alternatively, you can also cancel the first rectification deed and execute a fresh rectification deed with the correct details. However, this may involve more time and cost, as you may have to pay the stamp duty and registration fees again for cancelling and registering the new rectification deed.A deed of declaration is another option that you can consider. A deed of declaration is a document that declares or clarifies certain facts or circumstances related to a property or a transaction. A deed of declaration can be used to explain or supplement the information given in another document, such as a sale deed or a gift deed. A deed of declaration can also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable .The procedure to correct the typing error in your rectification deed may depend on your preference and convenience.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Developer suppressed the ongoing litigation while selling under construction flat",
    "answer": "You may have a case of fraud and misrepresentation against the developer for suppressing the pending litigation while selling the under construction flat. Fraud and misrepresentation are grounds for cancellation of contract and claiming damages under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Fraud is defined as any act or omission that is intended to deceive or induce another person to enter into a contract. Misrepresentation is defined as any statement or assertion that is untrue or misleading, but not made with an intention to deceive.Some of the elements of fraud and misrepresentation are:There must be a false or misleading statement or omission of a material fact by one party to another party.The statement or omission must relate to an essential or important aspect of the contract, such as the title, possession, quality, or value of the property.The statement or omission must induce or influence the other party to enter into the contract or act upon it.The other party must suffer some loss or injury as a result of relying on the statement or omission.In your case, you may be able to prove these elements by showing that:The developer did not inform you or disclose to you about the two pending litigation related to the project at the time of agreement and registration.The litigation was a material fact that affected the legal status and value of the property and your rights and interests as a buyer.You entered into the contract and paid 85% of the total payment based on the developer’s representation that the property was free from any legal disputes or encumbrances.You suffered loss and injury as you could not take possession of the property, faced legal action from the plaintiff, and had to stop further payment due to the litigation.Therefore, you may have a valid ground to cancel the contract and claim damages from the developer for fraud and misrepresentation.Some of the legal options available for you are:You can file a civil suit against the developer in the competent court in India for cancellation of contract, specific performance, injunction, declaration, or compensation. You can also seek interim relief from the court to restrain the developer from selling or transferring the property to any other person or creating any third party rights over it.You can file a criminal complaint against the developer in the police station or the magistrate’s court in India for cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, or criminal conspiracy under theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These offences are punishable with imprisonment and fine.You can file a consumer complaint against the developer in the consumer forum or commission in India for deficiency in service, unfair trade practice, or violation of consumer rights under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. You can claim refund, compensation, interest, or penalty from the developer.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for taking legal action against the developer for putting you in such a situation. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with the developer amicably through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offences are also non-bailable and non-compoundable.You can file a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 27(1)(d) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. You have to prove that your wife has treated you with such cruelty that it is not possible for you to live with her. You have to provide evidence of her cruel behaviour, such as audio recordings, video recordings, chat screenshots, witness statements, medical reports, etc. You can also claim alimony, custody, or maintenance from your wife depending on your circumstances.You can file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty under Section 10(1)(b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 23(1)(a) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court.

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "Ancestral property is a property that is inherited by a person from his or her ancestors, such as father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. In India, different personal laws govern the inheritance and succession of ancestral property among different communities. For Muslims, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the main law that regulates the inheritance and succession of ancestral property.According to Muslim law, inheritance of property takes place only after the death of a person and not by birth. The shares of the legal heirs are determined by the rules of Shariat, which are based on the Quran, Sunna, Ijma and Qiya. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim include his or her spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. The shares of each heir vary depending on their degree of relationship, gender and number.Partition of ancestral property is the process of dividing the property among the co-owners or co-sharers according to their respective shares. Partition can be done by mutual consent of the parties or by a court order. Partition can also be partial or total, depending on whether some or all of the properties are divided.To answer your follow-up question:If the majority of the members are in favour of partition except one, the court can appoint a commissioner to do the partition of the property. The commissioner will prepare a report and a preliminary decree based on the valuation and division of the property. The parties can raise their objections to the report and decree within a specified time. The court will then consider the objections and pass a final decree for partition.The valuation of the property can be decided by various methods, such as market value, income method, cost method, etc. The court can appoint a valuer or an expert to determine the value of the property based on these methods. The court can also rely on the evidence produced by the parties regarding the value of the property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Vested land means land that has been acquired by the state government under the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 or the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 for public purposes such as redistribution, development, or welfare. Vested land belongs to the state and cannot be sold or transferred by any private person without the permission of the state.If you have purchased a piece of vested land in Liluah, Howrah, you may face some legal problems in the future if you construct a home on this land. Some of the possible issues are:Invalid title: Your title to the vested land may be invalid or defective as the seller had no right or authority to sell the vested land to you.

    "question": "Divorcing wife is asking for 50% of all my properties and more",
    "answer": "Divorce is a legal process that results in the dissolution of a marriage, either through mutual consent or by filing a petition on various grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. It often involves addressing issues such as maintenance, alimony, child custody, and property division.Property division is the distribution of assets and liabilities between the parties after a divorce. This can be done through mutual agreement or a court order, with outcomes influenced by personal laws based on religion. In India, there is no uniform law for property division, but some general rules apply:Maintenance may be claimed by either spouse after divorce, especially if one cannot support themselves or the children.Asset division is typically based on ownership title, and financial contributions may be considered.Jointly owned assets are usually equally divided or based on the proportion contributed by each party.Uncontested divorces allow for mutual agreement on asset division.In the case of Hindu law, there are statutes that regulate various aspects of marriage and divorce, including property division:TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955TheHindu Succession Act, 1956The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956Under Hindu law, there are two types of property: ancestral and self-acquired. Ancestral property is inherited from ancestors, while self-acquired property is earned or acquired independently.A wife cannot claim ownership of her husband's property, but she has rights to stridhan (property exclusively belonging to her) and the right to reside in the marital home.Stridhan includes gifts, property from her own income, savings, or inheritance.In some cases, a wife may claim a share in a husband's company if she can prove her contribution to its growth.To summarize, in your specific situation:If your house and company are self-acquired and solely financed by you, your wife cannot claim 50% ownership.Maintenance may be claimed by your wife if she cannot support herself after divorce.Stridhan may be claimed if she has property under her name.She has a right to reside in your house until she remarries or passes away.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations in your specific case and gather reevant documents and evidence to support your claims.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Dispute on legal agreement with IOC",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are answers to your questions regarding the dispute on the legal agreement with IOC:Will this lease agreement be valid?The validity of the lease agreement depends on whether Vijay had the authority and consent of all the co-owners of the land to enter into such an agreement with IOC. If Vijay had obtained the power of attorney from Govind and Raj and also informed Guna about the lease agreement, then the lease agreement may be valid. However, if Vijay had acted without the consent or knowledge of Guna or you, then the lease agreement may be invalid and voidable. You can challenge the validity of the lease agreement in court on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, or breach of trust by Vijay.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. However, you may face difficulties in doing so, as IOC may claim that they are bona fide lessees who have paid rent and invested in the property in good faith. IOC may also claim that they are not aware of any dispute or defect in Vijay's title or authority to lease the land. You may have to prove that IOC had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay was not authorized to lease the land without your consent.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can also ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. Similar to IOC, the dealer may claim to be a sub-lessee or licensee of IOC who has acted in good faith. You may need to prove that the dealer had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay or IOC lacked the authority to lease the land without your consent.How to proceed with Vijay, who entered into a lease agreement with IOC without Guna?You can proceed against Vijay by sending him a legal notice or filing a suit for declaration and cancellation of the lease agreement in court. You can also claim damages for breach of trust and loss of income from Vijay. Seeking an injunction to restrain Vijay from interfering with your possession and enjoyment of your share of the land is an option as well.How to proceed further without going to court, like sending a letter of my own to IOC, the dealer, and Vijay?You can attempt to resolve the matter amicably by sending a letter explaining your situation and requesting them to vacate the petrol pump within a reasonable time. Offering some compensation for their investment and inconvenience might facilitate a resolution. However, if they refuse to cooperate or negotiate, you may need to seek legal assistance and pursue legal action.How to proceed further with a lawyer/court?To proceed further with a lawyer and court, you should consider hiring a lawyer experienced in property law and lease agreements. Consult with the lawyer to get advice on the best course of action. Discuss legal fees, expected timelines, and the likelihood of success for your case. Be prepared to provide all relevant documents and evidence to support your case, including Guna's registered document, the lease agreement between Vijay and IOC, the RTI reply from IOC, and any other pertinent records. Maintain communication with your lawyer to stay informed about case progress and outcomes.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. The lease agreement entered between IOC and Vijay is valid to the etent of Vijay's share at the time of entering into the lease agreement, however it appears that Guna has not raise any objection or had claimed a share out of the rental amount all through his lifetime after purchasing the 1/6th common share in the property.  However  it cannot be said that the lease agreement is invalid.2. Since Guna's share in the property has not been divided yet, the legal heirs of Guna can file a suit for partition and for separate possession of their share in the property. After that the legal heirs of deceased Guna can either continue the leas agreement by entering into a fresh lease agreement with IOC or can issue an eviction notice followed by an  eviction suit.3. The lease agreement is valid, however without identifying your share in the proeprty you cannot ask the IOC to vacate becasue there is a valid registered lease agreement and that too it is effective for over 23 years till this date.4. Suit for partition, read the answer given in point 2 above.5. You cannot solve the problem without involving legal steps.6.

    "answer": "A will is a legal document that expresses the wishes of a person regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will is valid only if it is made by a person who is of sound mind and free from undue influence, fraud or coercion. A will is also valid only if it is attested by two or more witnesses who are not beneficiaries under the will.In your case, since your uncle’s will has given you and your brothers the first floor rooms and your cousins the ground floor and land, you have to respect his wishes and abide by his will. You do not have any right on the land unless your uncle has given you any such right in his will or by any other means. However, you have some rights as the first floor owner, such as:The right to use and enjoy your property without any interference or disturbance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to repair and maintain your property as per your needs and preferences.The right to access and exit your property through the common staircase, passage or road without any obstruction or hindrance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to claim a share in the common expenses and amenities such as water, electricity, security, etc., that are incurred for the benefit of the entire building.The right to seek partition of the building if you are not satisfied with the arrangement or if there is any dispute or conflict with your cousins or anyone else.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Pay Protection",
    "answer": "Pay protection is a benefit given to candidates who join Central Government posts on direct recruitment basis from other sectors such as PSUs, State Governments, etc. Pay protection means that their initial pay in the Central Government post is fixed at a stage that protects their pay and allowances drawn in their previous sector. However, there are certain conditions and criteria for availing this benefit, such as:The candidate must have completed the probation period successfully in the previous sector and obtained a regular or confirmed status.The candidate must have applied for pay protection within one month from the date of joining the Central Government post.The candidate must have submitted the necessary documents such as NOC, pay certificate, service certificate, etc. from the previous sector.The candidate must have fulfilled the minimum experience requirement prescribed in the recruitment rules for the Central Government post.The candidate must have joined the Central Government post through a proper selection process such as interview or competitive exam or both.In your case, it seems that you have applied for pay protection in CPSU after joining from a State PSU in an experienced post. However, your application was rejected by your present company on the basis of lower CTC in your previous company and the rule of their major stake holder CPSU company. You have also submitted various documents and representations to review your application, but your present company has not responded positively. You have also found out that your present company has provided pay protection to other employees who joined from various CPSU and Central Govt Sector with lower CTC than yours. You have also discovered that your present company has framed a new rule for pay protection that segregates the industries in two categories, one for all CPSU and another for Central Govt/State Govt/State PSU etc. You have also received an RTI reply from your present company that provides this rule reference to whom they provided pay protection 10 years before.Based on these facts, you may have a valid ground to file petitions in court/outside platform for pay protection. You can take the following steps to do so:Collect evidence: You should collect all the relevant evidence to support your claim for pay protection, such as:Your appointment letter and joining report in CPSUYour NOC and pay certificate from State PSUYour service certificate and experience certificate from State PSUYour pay slips and CTC details from State PSU and CPSUYour application and representations for pay protection in CPSUThe rejection letter and RTI reply from CPSUThe recruitment rules and eligibility criteria for your post in CPSUThe pay protection rules and guidelines issued by DPE or DOPT or any other authorityThe details of other employees who got pay protection in CPSU with lower CTC than yoursChoose a forum: You should choose a suitable forum to file your petitions, depending on the nature and value of your claim. Some of the possible forums are:Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT): This is a quasi-judicial body that deals with service disputes of Central Government employees. You can file an original application (OA) in CAT seeking quashing of the rejection letter, direction for pay protection, declaration of your rights, and compensation for loss and harassment. You can also file an interim application (IA) seeking stay of any adverse action against you by CPSU pending disposal of OA. You can file an OA in CAT within six months from the date of rejection letter or any other cause of action.High Court: This is a constitutional court that has jurisdiction over all matters arising within its territorial limits. You can file a writ petition in High Court under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiaseeking writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto, or any other appropriate writs or orders against CPSU or any other authority for violation of your fundamental rights or legal rights. You can also file an interim application (IA) seeking stay of any adverse action against you by CPSU pending disposal of writ petition. You can file a writ petition in High Court within three years from the date of rejection letter or any other cause of action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Recovery of joining bonus in case I resign before 1 year",
    "answer": "The clause in your offer letter means that if you resign from your job within one year of your date of joining, you will have to pay back the entire amount of the joining bonus to your employer. The joining bonus is a sum of money paid to you by your employer as an incentive for joining their company. It is usually subject to taxes and deductions as per the applicable laws and regulations. However, if you leave your job before completing a certain period of service, the bonus may be recovered by your employer as a penalty for breaching the contract.The term “resign” means to voluntarily quit or leave your job. It does not matter whether you serve the notice period or not, as long as you initiate the termination of your employment contract. Therefore, even if you serve more than a year in total, including the notice period, you will still be liable to pay back the joining bonus if you resign within one year of your date of joining.For example, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 3rd October 2023, you will have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned within one year of your date of joining (12th December 2022 to 11th December 2023). However, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 12th December 2023 or later, you will not have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is before 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned after completing one year of service.This is the general interpretation of the clause based on the common usage and meaning of the words. However, there may be some variations and exceptions depending on the specific terms and conditions of your employment contract, the policies and practices of your employer, and the laws and regulations governing labour and taxation in your jurisdiction. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before taking any action based on this information.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

During this notice period, you are usually still considered an employee, and you may be expected to continue performing your job responsibilities, unless your employer chooses to relieve you of your duties immediately and pay you in lieu of notice.So, you do not have to pay joining bonus back to your company and if they ask you to do so then that is not tenable in the eyes of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Requirement of recording the compromise entered in lok adalat",
    "answer": "The Compromise entered in Lok Adalat , whether falls under “Compromise Out of Court”A compromise entered in Lok Adalat does not fall under the category of “compromise out of court”. A compromise out of court is a settlement between the parties without the intervention or approval of the court. A compromise in Lok Adalat, on the other hand, is a settlement between the parties with the assistance and consent of the Lok Adalat, which is a statutory body under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. A compromise in Lok Adalat has the same effect as a decree of a civil court and is binding and final on the parties. Therefore, a compromise in Lok Adalat is different from a compromise out of court.Whether such compromise (Considering out of Court) requires to be recorded before Executing Court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides that where any money payable under a decree of any kind is paid out of court or where any property movable or immovable is transferred by any party to a suit to another in satisfaction of his claim under such decree, such payment or transfer shall be certified to the court whose duty it is to execute such decree. However, this rule does not apply to a compromise in Lok Adalat, as it is not a payment or transfer out of court, but a settlement in Lok Adalat. Moreover, as per Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a civil court and shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and no appeal shall lie to any court against such award. Therefore, such compromise does not require to be recorded before executing court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.If reply is “yes” from Experts…then How to satisfy the Executing Court, In view of settled law of SC cited above.Since the reply is “no” from me, this question does not arise. However, if you still want to know how to satisfy the executing court in case of a compromise in Lok Adalat, you may have to produce the award or certificate issued by the Lok Adalat before the executing court and seek its execution as per Order 21 Rule 11 CPC. You may also have to show that there was no fraud or coercion involved in the compromise and that it was voluntary and lawful. However, you should consult a lawyer and follow his or her advice before taking any action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "The courts generally do not entertain the execution of RCR decree for attachment of property.Besides the attachment of property on your name cannot be done just like that i.e., at least not in the manner that you say.You should have a control over your anxiety.The court cannot pass an order to attach the property without knowing that the property is on your name, hence it will pass an order to the District collector, who in turn will instruct the concerned Revenue office to produce the list of immovable properties lying on your name.After that also the process is cumbersome.As far as RCR decree is concerned the HMA itself provides that the person presenting petition cannot take advantage of his/her own wrong to get a decree in her favor.  As far as the respondent case is  concerned very lengthy arguments have taken place that RCR provision itself is violation of Article 21 ofConstitution of Indiaand there are many case laws to that effect.  In my view  it is not possible to enforce RCR decree by any other method because it is your  right to choose between joining her or not joining her.. RCR is only a directional decree not an compelling decree.Therefore you may not be worried to the extent what you have expressed here in this regard.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. It is available under various personal laws in India, such as theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936.If a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsis passed by the court and the respondent does not comply with it within one year, the petitioner can file an application for attachment and sale of the respondent’s property under Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court may order the attachment of any movable or immovable property of the respondent and direct its sale after six months of attachment. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the court may award such compensation to the petitioner as it thinks fit and pay the balance to the respondent.However, the court has to consider various factors before ordering the attachment and sale of property, such as the nature and value of the property, the income and expenses of both parties, the hardship caused to the respondent, and the possibility of reconciliation. The court also has to ensure that the attachment and sale of property is not oppressive or excessive and does not violate the fundamental rights of the respondent. The court has to balance the interests of both parties and act in accordance with justice, equity and good conscience.Therefore, in your case, it is not certain that the court will order the attachment and sale of your movable property worth 17L as compensation for non-compliance of RCR decree. It will depend on the facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider other modes of execution, such as imprisonment or community service. The amount of compensation awarded by the court may vary from case to case depending on various factors. There is no fixed formula or standard for determining the compensation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "GPA holder vs actual owner",
    "answer": "AGeneral Power of Attorney (GPA)is a document through which one person (Principal) appoints another person (GPA Holder) to do all acts specified therein, for and on behalf of the Principal. A GPA holder is not the owner of the property by virtue of the GPA. A GPA holder only has the authority to carry out tasks assigned by the owner, excluding selling of property. A GPA holder is not authorised to sell the property on behalf of the owner, even if the GPA is recorded with the sub-office. The Supreme Court of India has held that transactions of the nature of GPA sales do not convey any title and do not amount to transfer, nor can they be recognized or valid mode of transfer of immovable property.Therefore, if Ravikumar bought the site from Chandra, who was only a GPA holder of Sukumar Shastri, then Ravikumar did not acquire any valid title or ownership of the site. Similarly, if you bought the site from Ravikumar, then you also did not acquire any valid title or ownership of the site. The actual owner of the site would be Sukumar Shastri or his legal heirs, unless he had executed a registered sale deed in favour of N. Reddy or any other person.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding orders for IA petition",
    "answer": "An IA petition is an interlocutory application, which is an application moved in the main petition for some urgent relief or to bring some new facts to the notice of the court. An interlocutory order is an order passed in such an application, which is not final and is subject to change or modification. The procedure for filing and hearing an IA petition is the same as that of the original suit, in matters like recording of evidence, examining witnesses, etc.According to Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the High Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. Similarly, the District Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. The transfer of a case from one court to another may be done for various reasons, such as convenience of parties, speedy disposal of justice, impartiality of judges, etc.In your case, since your IA petition was transferred from one court to another due to the absence of a judge in the original court, and since the arguments were done again in the new court and it is posted for orders now, it is likely that the orders will be passed in the new court where the arguments are over. However, this may also depend on the discretion of the High Court or the District Court that has the power to transfer your case. If they decide to transfer your case back to the original court where a judge is appointed now, then you may have to argue your case again before that judge. Therefore, you should consult your lawyer and follow the updates on your case status.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "You have been caught with alcohol in Bihar, where there is a complete prohibition of liquor since April 2016. According to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, any person who manufactures, bottles, distributes, transports, collects, stores, possesses, purchases, sells or consumes any intoxicant or liquor is liable to be punished with imprisonment and fine. The punishment may vary depending on the quantity of liquor involved and the number of offences committed. For example, if a person is caught with more than 5 litres of liquor for the first time, he may be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.You have been arrested and sent to jail for 44 hours before getting bail. This means that you have a criminal record which may affect your job prospects in the government sector. According to a Supreme Court judgment, a person facing criminal cases cannot be considered suitable for appointment in government service unless acquitted of the charges. The court also held that the employer has the right to verify the antecedents of the candidates and reject those who have criminal cases pending against them.Therefore, if you want to apply for a government job, you may have to disclose your criminal record and face the possibility of rejection. You may also have to undergo a background verification process which may include checking your court records and police records. You may also have to produce a certificate of good conduct from the authorities concerned.However, you have also mentioned that no one called you regarding the case for one year. This may mean that the case has not been pursued by the prosecution or that there is some delay or error in the judicial process.

    "question": "Order 21 Rule 2 clarification after yesterday's post",
    "answer": "The remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to whether there was a valid compromise or  not. This is so because a consent decree is nothing but contract between parties superimposed with the seal of  approval of the court. The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the agreement or compromise on which it is made.Finality of decisions is an underlying principle of all adjudicating forums. Thus, creation of further litigation should never be the basis of a compromise between the parties. Rule 3-A Order 23 CPC put a specific bar that no suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful. The scheme of Order 23 Rule 3 CPC is to avoid multiplicity of litigation and permit parties to amicably come to a settlement which is lawful, is in writing and a voluntary act on the part of the parties. The court can be instrumental in having an agreed compromise effected and finality attached to the same. The court should never be party to imposition of a compromise upon an unwilling party, still open to be questioned on an application under theproviso to Order 23 Rule 3 CPC before the court.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father is not allowing my mother to sell his gifted property",
    "answer": "According to theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can file for divorce on two grounds: mutual consent or contested divorce.Mutual consent divorceis when both spouses agree to end their marriage amicably and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, and property division. Contested divorce is when one spouse files for divorce without the consent of the other spouse on certain grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, mental disorder, etc.If your mother wants to file for a contested divorce, she will have to prove the ground on which she is seeking divorce in the court. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process. The procedure of contested divorce may vary depending on the location and the court where the petition is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of a petition: The spouse who wants to file for divorce has to prepare a petition stating the facts and grounds of the case. The petition has to be filed in the family court or district court where the spouses last resided together or where the marriage was solemnized.Service of notice: The court will issue a notice to the other spouse along with a copy of the petition. The other spouse has to file a written statement in response to the petition within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine the petition and the written statement and frame the issues that need to be decided in the case. The issues may relate to the grounds of divorce, alimony, child custody, property division, etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both spouses have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have to cross-examine each other and their witnesses in the court.Arguments and judgment: After the completion of evidence and cross-examination, both spouses have to present their arguments before the judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the divorce petition.The duration of a contested divorce may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a contested divorce to be finalized.If your mother wants to sell the gifted property that your father gave her, she will have to prove that she has a valid title over it. A gift deed is a legal document that describes the voluntary transfer of a property from a donor (owner of the property) to a donee (receiver of gift) without any monetary favor in return. The donor should not be insolvent and should not use this as a tool for evasion of tax and illegal gains.Registering a gift deed with the sub-registrar is mandatory under the laws in India (Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 and Section 123 of theTransfer of Property Act.) If this is not done, the transfer will be invalid. Once a gift deed is registered, only then the change in the title of ownership of property is possible.If your father is not allowing your mother to sell the gifted property, he may be challenging the validity of the gift deed or claiming that he has revoked it. A gift deed can be revoked by mutual consent of both parties or by rescinding it in a court of law on certain grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, mistake, etc.Your mother may have to file a suit for declaration and injunction in a civil court to assert her right over the gifted property and restrain your father from interfering with it. She will have to produce the registered gift deed and other documents to prove her title over it. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process.The procedure of filing a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the location and the court where it is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of plaint: The plaintiff (your mother) has to prepare a plaint stating the facts and relief sought in the case. The plaint has to be filed in the civil court having jurisdiction over the matter along with court fees and other documents.Service of summons: The court will issue summons to the defendant (your father) along with a copy of plaint. The defendant has to file a written statement in response to plaint within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine plaint and written statement and frame issues that need to be decided in case. The issues may relate to validity of gift deed, title over property, revocation of gift deed etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both parties have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have cross-examine each other and their witnesses in court.Arguments and judgment: After completion of evidence and cross-examination, both parties have to present their arguments before judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the suit.The duration of a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a suit to be finalized.I hope this information helps you understand the legal options available to you and your mother.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution. However, you may be able to get some benefits under the OBC category if your caste is listed as an OBC by the state or central government.You may also be able to pursue your legal challenge against the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before the Supreme Court or other competent authorities. However, this may take a long time and involve a lot of litigation and uncertainty.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "According to the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, an Overseas Indian citizen, who is a person of Indian origin (PIO) or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), can inherit any immovable property in India from anyone, including their relatives. The property can be residential, commercial, agricultural or a farmhouse. The NRI can inherit property in India even from another NRI, subject to certain conditions.The process to register the property in the son’s name after inheriting it from the father may vary depending on the state and the type of property. However, some general steps are as follows:Obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority or the court. This certificate establishes the relationship between the deceased and the legal heirs. It may require documents such as death certificate of the father, birth certificate of the son, identity proofs of the legal heirs, etc.Obtain a succession certificate from the court. This certificate grants the right to inherit the property to the legal heirs. It may require documents such as legal heir certificate, copy of the will (if any), affidavit by the legal heirs, etc.Transfer the title of the property in the son’s name by executing a relinquishment deed or a family settlement deed. These deeds are used to transfer the rights and interests of other legal heirs in favor of one heir. They have to be signed by all the legal heirs and attested by two witnesses. They also have to be stamped and registered with the sub-registrar of the area where the property is located.Pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property. The stamp duty and registration fees may vary depending on the state and the value of the property. They have to be paid online or offline before registering the deed.Update the revenue records of the property with the local authority or the revenue department. This is done to reflect the change in ownership and tax liability of the property. It may require documents such as copy of the registered deed, mutation application, identity proof of the son, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in dealing with a forest offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This is a law that regulates the conservation and management of forests and forest produce in India. It also provides for the penalties and procedures for forest offences, such as cutting, uprooting, or damaging trees or plants without permission.The legal matters related to the compounding of forest offences are governed by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This section empowers the State Government to authorize a Forest Officer of a rank not inferior to that of a Ranger to accept a sum of money from a person who is suspected of committing a forest offence, other than an offence specified in Section 62 or Section 63 of the Act, as compensation for the offence. The Forest Officer can also release any property seized as liable to confiscation on payment of its value. On such payment, the suspected person and the property are discharged and no further proceedings are taken against them.Based on this section, I can try to answer your queries as follows:If the range officer compounds the above offence, it is unlikely that a more senior officer from the forest department can challenge or revoke this compounding on any grounds or challenge it in court. This is because Section 68(2) of the Act clearly states that no further proceedings shall be taken against the person or property once the compounding is done. Moreover, Section 69 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any forest offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder except on complaint made by certain authorities within six months from the date of commission of the offence. Therefore, unless there is any fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion involved in the compounding process, it is final and binding on both parties.If you compound the offence, it does not necessarily imply that you have admitted doing it. It only means that you have agreed to pay a sum of money as compensation for the offence that you are suspected of committing. It is possible that you may have done so to avoid further litigation and hassle, even though you are innocent. However, it may also affect your reputation and credibility, as it may create an impression that you are guilty or involved in some way. Whether your name will be recorded as an offender or a suspect in the database of the forest department depends on their internal policy and practice. You may request them to clarify this point before compounding the offence.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the range officer compounds the offense, it's typically a legally binding agreement, and it would usually not be challenged or revoked by a more senior officer unless there are strong grounds to do so, such as evidence of fraud or coercion in the compounding process. However, it's essential to consult with a legal expert in India for specific advice on your situation.Compounding an offense generally does not imply an admission of guilt. It is more like a settlement where you agree to pay a fine or compensation in exchange for avoiding a more extended legal process. Your name might be recorded as a party involved in the compounding process, but it doesn't necessarily label you as a convict.Regarding your additional questions:The compounding process is typically done by the forest officer empowered by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, not by the court. If you agree to pay the compensation, it is a voluntary agreement between you and the forest department.The reason compounding might not lead to acquittal for forest offenses is because the purpose of compounding is often to provide an expedited resolution and collect compensation for environmental damage, rather than a criminal trial leading to acquittal. Each offense and its legal implications can vary, so it's crucial to consult with a legal expert who can provide specific guidance based on your situation and the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need citation stating that BBMP cannot issue Khatha for property that is under dispute and is in the",
    "answer": "Khatha is a document that records the details of a property owner in the records of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike). It is not a proof of ownership, but an evidence of assessment of property tax. Khatha can be issued, transferred, bifurcated or amalgamated by the BBMP based on the documents submitted by the property owner, such as sale deed, conversion order, layout plan, etc.However, the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for a property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. This is because the BBMP has to verify the validity and legality of the documents submitted by the property owner before issuing Khatha. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding the ownership or title of the property, the BBMP has to wait for the court’s decision before issuing Khatha.There are some citations that support this principle. For example, in Dr.S. Shobha vs The Commissioner Bbmp on 20 September, 2021, the Karnataka High Court held that:“The BBMP cannot issue khata in favour of any person without verifying the legality and validity of documents produced by such person. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding such documents, it is open for the BBMP to refuse to issue khata and direct such person to obtain a declaration of title from a competent court.”Similarly, in Here’s why BBMP Khata is not a proof of ownership for your property, it is stated that:“The Karnataka High Court has ruled that if there is any dispute regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without verifying all relevant documents and obtaining legal opinion from its legal cell. The Court also held that if there are any pending court cases regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without waiting for the outcome of such cases.” Citation: ILR2009KAR458, 2009 (3)KarLJ630 (and on the net in MANU/KA/0450/2008)Therefore, based on these citations, you can argue that the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for your property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. You can also submit copies of the court orders that have dismissed or stayed the claims of [PERSON 1]'s grandchildren as evidence of your title and possession.I hope this information helps you. I wish you all the best for your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership can be formed by an oral or written agreement between two or more persons. The registration of a partnership firm is not mandatory, but it has certain advantages and disadvantages. A registered partnership firm has legal recognition and can sue or be sued in its own name. An unregistered partnership firm, on the other hand, has certain limitations and disabilities, such as not being able to enforce its rights or obligations against third parties or other partners in a court of law.The legality of your father’s partnership firm may depend on the nature and terms of the agreement that he had with his friend. If there was a written partnership deed that clearly defined the roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing ratio of each partner, then it may be considered as a valid agreement between them. However, if there was no written partnership deed or if the partnership deed was vague or ambiguous, then it may be difficult to prove the existence and validity of the partnership in a court of law.The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, is an act that regulates the production, supply, and distribution of certain commodities that are essential for the public. The act empowers the central and state governments to issue licenses and permits for dealing with such commodities and to impose restrictions and penalties for violating the provisions of the act. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, is an act that governs the formation and enforcement of contracts in India. The act lays down the principles and rules for valid contracts, their performance, breach, and remedies.Your father’s partnership firm may be illegal under the Essential Commodities Act if it was dealing with fertilizers without a valid license issued by the state government. This may attract criminal liability and penalties under the act. Your father may also be liable under the Indian Contract Act if he breached any contractual obligations that he had with his customers or suppliers.Your claim for money due from your father’s partner may not be dismissed if you can prove that your father was a partner in the firm and that he had contributed capital and was entitled to a share of profits as per the partnership deed. You may also have to prove that your father’s partner owes him money as per the audited financial statements of the firm. You may have to file a civil suit for recovery of money against your father’s partner in the court of competent jurisdiction.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "An unregistered partnership deed is still a valid agreement between the partners but has certain limitations. It cannot be used as evidence to settle disputes between partners or third parties in a court of law. Partners cannot enforce rights or obligations under the partnership deed against third parties.As a consequence of the non-registration of the firm,a partnership firm cannot approach the legal authorities for help in case of any dispute or breach of contract. To do so, the firm or the concerned partner has to have its name registered with the Registrar of Firms.a partner of an erstwhile unregistered partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce a right arising out of a contract hit by the provision of section 69 or the partnership act .

While it's ideal for partnerships to be registered, unregistered partnerships are not necessarily illegal.The fact that your father does not have a license for dealing in fertilizers may be a separate issue related to compliance with the Essential Commodities Act and other relevant regulations. This may need to be addressed separately from the partnership issue.Regarding the money your father is owed based on the partnership agreement, you may still have a valid claim for it. The partnership deed should outline the terms of capital contribution, remuneration, and profit-sharing.

    "question": "Higher education loan: reduction in maintenance",
    "answer": "Maintenance is the amount payable by the husband to his wife in case she is unable to maintain herself either during the subsistence of the marriage or upon separation and divorce. Maintenance should include necessarily include a provision for residence. The amount of maintenance given to a wife is determined by various factors, such as the parties’ position and status, legitimate needs of the claimant, the claimant’s property worth and any income received from it, or from the claimant’s own income, or from any other source.According to Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act,1955, the Applicant being either the husband or wife is entitled to receive his or her maintenance from the spouse in the form of a gross sum or monthly sum for a term not exceeding the lifetime of the applicant or until the applicant remarries. The court may vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the court may deem just if it appears to the court that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has been made.Therefore, if you take a loan for higher education, it may affect the amount of maintenance that you have to pay to your wife, depending on how it changes your income and expenses. The court may consider your education loan EMI as a factor while calculating maintenance, but it may not necessarily reduce the maintenance amount. The court may also look at other factors, such as your earning potential after completing your higher education, your wife’s financial needs and status, and the best interests of your children (if any).Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property by HUF",
    "answer": "HUF stands for Hindu Undivided Family. It is a separate legal entity that can be formed by a Hindu family consisting of a common ancestor and his lineal descendants, along with their wives and unmarried daughters. A HUF can own property, run a business, invest in various assets, and file tax returns in its own name. A HUF has its own PAN and enjoys a separate basic tax exemption of Rs. 2.50 lakh in addition to the tax exemption of each of its members.To form a HUF, you need to follow these steps:Write an HUF deed on a stamp paper, stating the names of the HUF’s karta, coparceners and members. The karta is the senior-most male member who manages the affairs of the HUF. The coparceners are the male members who have a right to demand a share in the HUF property. The members are the female members and minor children who have a right to maintenance from the HUF.Apply for an HUF PAN card using Form 49A at the NSDL website.Open an HUF bank account.To transfer your property to your HUF, you need to execute a deed of assignment or gift in favour of your HUF, stating that you are transferring your individual rights in the property to your HUF as a gift or for consideration. You may have to pay stamp duty and registration charges on such transfer, depending on the state laws.When you sell the property as an HUF, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition or improvement of the property. The capital gains tax rate depends on whether the property is long-term or short-term, depending on the period of holding. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefit, while short-term capital gains are taxed at the normal slab rates applicable to the HUF. You can claim exemption from capital gains tax by investing the sale proceeds in another residential property or specified bonds under Section 54 or 54EC of the Income Tax Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "plot no. Mentioned in saatbara and sale deed  are different what is actual document of ownershipr",
    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

A, it holds significant legal weight. However, it's essential to verify the authenticity of the sale deed.Adjacent Plot A: If someone else has occupied and built on plot A, which your mother believes she owns according to the sale deed, this could lead to a legal dispute.Correction by Tahsil Office: If the tahsil office can correct the survey number to match the sale deed, it may help establish your mother's ownership of plot A. However, this may require legal procedures and documentation.a. Verify the authenticity of the sale deed. b. Assist in correcting the survey number with the tahsil office if necessary. c.

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Higher education loan: reduction in maintenance",
    "answer": "Maintenance is the amount payable by the husband to his wife in case she is unable to maintain herself either during the subsistence of the marriage or upon separation and divorce. Maintenance should include necessarily include a provision for residence. The amount of maintenance given to a wife is determined by various factors, such as the parties’ position and status, legitimate needs of the claimant, the claimant’s property worth and any income received from it, or from the claimant’s own income, or from any other source.According to Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act,1955, the Applicant being either the husband or wife is entitled to receive his or her maintenance from the spouse in the form of a gross sum or monthly sum for a term not exceeding the lifetime of the applicant or until the applicant remarries. The court may vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the court may deem just if it appears to the court that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has been made.Therefore, if you take a loan for higher education, it may affect the amount of maintenance that you have to pay to your wife, depending on how it changes your income and expenses. The court may consider your education loan EMI as a factor while calculating maintenance, but it may not necessarily reduce the maintenance amount. The court may also look at other factors, such as your earning potential after completing your higher education, your wife’s financial needs and status, and the best interests of your children (if any).Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "plot no. Mentioned in saatbara and sale deed  are different what is actual document of ownershipr",
    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

A, it holds significant legal weight. However, it's essential to verify the authenticity of the sale deed.Adjacent Plot A: If someone else has occupied and built on plot A, which your mother believes she owns according to the sale deed, this could lead to a legal dispute.Correction by Tahsil Office: If the tahsil office can correct the survey number to match the sale deed, it may help establish your mother's ownership of plot A. However, this may require legal procedures and documentation.a. Verify the authenticity of the sale deed. b. Assist in correcting the survey number with the tahsil office if necessary. c. Evaluate the situation regarding the occupied plot A and recommend appropriate legal actions, such as eviction if your mother is indeed the rightful owner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding orders for IA petition",
    "answer": "An IA petition is an interlocutory application, which is an application moved in the main petition for some urgent relief or to bring some new facts to the notice of the court. An interlocutory order is an order passed in such an application, which is not final and is subject to change or modification. The procedure for filing and hearing an IA petition is the same as that of the original suit, in matters like recording of evidence, examining witnesses, etc.According to Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the High Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. Similarly, the District Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. The transfer of a case from one court to another may be done for various reasons, such as convenience of parties, speedy disposal of justice, impartiality of judges, etc.In your case, since your IA petition was transferred from one court to another due to the absence of a judge in the original court, and since the arguments were done again in the new court and it is posted for orders now, it is likely that the orders will be passed in the new court where the arguments are over. However, this may also depend on the discretion of the High Court or the District Court that has the power to transfer your case. If they decide to transfer your case back to the original court where a judge is appointed now, then you may have to argue your case again before that judge. Therefore, you should consult your lawyer and follow the updates on your case status.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Requirement of recording the compromise entered in lok adalat",
    "answer": "The Compromise entered in Lok Adalat , whether falls under “Compromise Out of Court”A compromise entered in Lok Adalat does not fall under the category of “compromise out of court”. A compromise out of court is a settlement between the parties without the intervention or approval of the court. A compromise in Lok Adalat, on the other hand, is a settlement between the parties with the assistance and consent of the Lok Adalat, which is a statutory body under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. A compromise in Lok Adalat has the same effect as a decree of a civil court and is binding and final on the parties. Therefore, a compromise in Lok Adalat is different from a compromise out of court.Whether such compromise (Considering out of Court) requires to be recorded before Executing Court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides that where any money payable under a decree of any kind is paid out of court or where any property movable or immovable is transferred by any party to a suit to another in satisfaction of his claim under such decree, such payment or transfer shall be certified to the court whose duty it is to execute such decree. However, this rule does not apply to a compromise in Lok Adalat, as it is not a payment or transfer out of court, but a settlement in Lok Adalat. Moreover, as per Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a civil court and shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and no appeal shall lie to any court against such award. Therefore, such compromise does not require to be recorded before executing court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.If reply is “yes” from Experts…then How to satisfy the Executing Court, In view of settled law of SC cited above.Since the reply is “no” from me, this question does not arise. However, if you still want to know how to satisfy the executing court in case of a compromise in Lok Adalat, you may have to produce the award or certificate issued by the Lok Adalat before the executing court and seek its execution as per Order 21 Rule 11 CPC. You may also have to show that there was no fraud or coercion involved in the compromise and that it was voluntary and lawful. However, you should consult a lawyer and follow his or her advice before taking any action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

If you believe that allowing the construction would prejudice your interests, it's essential to continue pursuing this matter in court. Your lawyer can file an application for permanent injunction or any other appropriate legal remedy to prevent construction that may affect the valuation of the property.Status Quo of Property: The existing status quo of the property can be an important factor in partition cases. You should document and present evidence in court to support your argument regarding the depreciated superstructure.Notice to Co-Owners: The fact that you issued a notice and the co-owners did not object to the ongoing construction may be relevant in court. Your lawyer can use this as evidence to establish that they were aware of the construction activities.Property Demarcation and Auction: If demarcation of the property is not feasible, and if you believe that a fair division cannot be achieved, you can request the court to order the sale of the property and distribute the proceeds among the co-owners as per their shares. Your lawyer can file a partition suit for the sale of the property.Contesting the Case Online: Courts in India have increasingly started using online platforms for case management and hearings. Depending on the specific court and its procedures, it may be possible to participate in the case online from Chennai. Your lawyer can guide you on this and help you set up any necessary online appearances.Lodging Complaints: If you suspect wrongdoing or conspiracy by the other co-owners, you can consider lodging complaints with the appropriate authorities.

    "answer": "Dear client,Here are some responses to your questions:Challenge to Construction Activities: You've already taken a positive step by obtaining a stay order to prevent further construction. If you believe that allowing the construction would prejudice your interests, it's essential to continue pursuing this matter in court. Your lawyer can file an application for permanent injunction or any other appropriate legal remedy to prevent construction that may affect the valuation of the property.Status Quo of Property: The existing status quo of the property can be an important factor in partition cases. You should document and present evidence in court to support your argument regarding the depreciated superstructure.Notice to Co-Owners: The fact that you issued a notice and the co-owners did not object to the ongoing construction may be relevant in court. Your lawyer can use this as evidence to establish that they were aware of the construction activities.Property Demarcation and Auction: If demarcation of the property is not feasible, and if you believe that a fair division cannot be achieved, you can request the court to order the sale of the property and distribute the proceeds among the co-owners as per their shares. Your lawyer can file a partition suit for the sale of the property.Contesting the Case Online: Courts in India have increasingly started using online platforms for case management and hearings. Depending on the specific court and its procedures, it may be possible to participate in the case online from Chennai. Your lawyer can guide you on this and help you set up any necessary online appearances.Lodging Complaints: If you suspect wrongdoing or conspiracy by the other co-owners, you can consider lodging complaints with the appropriate authorities. These could include complaints related to property fraud, criminal conspiracy, or other relevant offenses. Your lawyer can advise you on the specific complaints to file and where to file them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "The courts generally do not entertain the execution of RCR decree for attachment of property.Besides the attachment of property on your name cannot be done just like that i.e., at least not in the manner that you say.You should have a control over your anxiety.The court cannot pass an order to attach the property without knowing that the property is on your name, hence it will pass an order to the District collector, who in turn will instruct the concerned Revenue office to produce the list of immovable properties lying on your name.After that also the process is cumbersome.As far as RCR decree is concerned the HMA itself provides that the person presenting petition cannot take advantage of his/her own wrong to get a decree in her favor.  As far as the respondent case is  concerned very lengthy arguments have taken place that RCR provision itself is violation of Article 21 ofConstitution of Indiaand there are many case laws to that effect.  In my view  it is not possible to enforce RCR decree by any other method because it is your  right to choose between joining her or not joining her.. RCR is only a directional decree not an compelling decree.Therefore you may not be worried to the extent what you have expressed here in this regard.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. It is available under various personal laws in India, such as theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936.If a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsis passed by the court and the respondent does not comply with it within one year, the petitioner can file an application for attachment and sale of the respondent’s property under Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court may order the attachment of any movable or immovable property of the respondent and direct its sale after six months of attachment. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the court may award such compensation to the petitioner as it thinks fit and pay the balance to the respondent.However, the court has to consider various factors before ordering the attachment and sale of property, such as the nature and value of the property, the income and expenses of both parties, the hardship caused to the respondent, and the possibility of reconciliation. The court also has to ensure that the attachment and sale of property is not oppressive or excessive and does not violate the fundamental rights of the respondent. The court has to balance the interests of both parties and act in accordance with justice, equity and good conscience.Therefore, in your case, it is not certain that the court will order the attachment and sale of your movable property worth 17L as compensation for non-compliance of RCR decree. It will depend on the facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider other modes of execution, such as imprisonment or community service. The amount of compensation awarded by the court may vary from case to case depending on various factors. There is no fixed formula or standard for determining the compensation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Recovery of joining bonus in case I resign before 1 year",
    "answer": "The clause in your offer letter means that if you resign from your job within one year of your date of joining, you will have to pay back the entire amount of the joining bonus to your employer. The joining bonus is a sum of money paid to you by your employer as an incentive for joining their company. It is usually subject to taxes and deductions as per the applicable laws and regulations. However, if you leave your job before completing a certain period of service, the bonus may be recovered by your employer as a penalty for breaching the contract.The term “resign” means to voluntarily quit or leave your job. It does not matter whether you serve the notice period or not, as long as you initiate the termination of your employment contract. Therefore, even if you serve more than a year in total, including the notice period, you will still be liable to pay back the joining bonus if you resign within one year of your date of joining.For example, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 3rd October 2023, you will have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned within one year of your date of joining (12th December 2022 to 11th December 2023). However, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 12th December 2023 or later, you will not have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is before 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned after completing one year of service.This is the general interpretation of the clause based on the common usage and meaning of the words. However, there may be some variations and exceptions depending on the specific terms and conditions of your employment contract, the policies and practices of your employer, and the laws and regulations governing labour and taxation in your jurisdiction. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before taking any action based on this information.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

During this notice period, you are usually still considered an employee, and you may be expected to continue performing your job responsibilities, unless your employer chooses to relieve you of your duties immediately and pay you in lieu of notice.So, you do not have to pay joining bonus back to your company and if they ask you to do so then that is not tenable in the eyes of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Dispute on legal agreement with IOC",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are answers to your questions regarding the dispute on the legal agreement with IOC:Will this lease agreement be valid?The validity of the lease agreement depends on whether Vijay had the authority and consent of all the co-owners of the land to enter into such an agreement with IOC. If Vijay had obtained the power of attorney from Govind and Raj and also informed Guna about the lease agreement, then the lease agreement may be valid. However, if Vijay had acted without the consent or knowledge of Guna or you, then the lease agreement may be invalid and voidable. You can challenge the validity of the lease agreement in court on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, or breach of trust by Vijay.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. However, you may face difficulties in doing so, as IOC may claim that they are bona fide lessees who have paid rent and invested in the property in good faith. IOC may also claim that they are not aware of any dispute or defect in Vijay's title or authority to lease the land. You may have to prove that IOC had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay was not authorized to lease the land without your consent.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can also ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. Similar to IOC, the dealer may claim to be a sub-lessee or licensee of IOC who has acted in good faith. You may need to prove that the dealer had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay or IOC lacked the authority to lease the land without your consent.How to proceed with Vijay, who entered into a lease agreement with IOC without Guna?You can proceed against Vijay by sending him a legal notice or filing a suit for declaration and cancellation of the lease agreement in court. You can also claim damages for breach of trust and loss of income from Vijay. Seeking an injunction to restrain Vijay from interfering with your possession and enjoyment of your share of the land is an option as well.How to proceed further without going to court, like sending a letter of my own to IOC, the dealer, and Vijay?You can attempt to resolve the matter amicably by sending a letter explaining your situation and requesting them to vacate the petrol pump within a reasonable time. Offering some compensation for their investment and inconvenience might facilitate a resolution. However, if they refuse to cooperate or negotiate, you may need to seek legal assistance and pursue legal action.How to proceed further with a lawyer/court?To proceed further with a lawyer and court, you should consider hiring a lawyer experienced in property law and lease agreements. Consult with the lawyer to get advice on the best course of action. Discuss legal fees, expected timelines, and the likelihood of success for your case. Be prepared to provide all relevant documents and evidence to support your case, including Guna's registered document, the lease agreement between Vijay and IOC, the RTI reply from IOC, and any other pertinent records. Maintain communication with your lawyer to stay informed about case progress and outcomes.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Since Guna's share in the property has not been divided yet, the legal heirs of Guna can file a suit for partition and for separate possession of their share in the property. After that the legal heirs of deceased Guna can either continue the leas agreement by entering into a fresh lease agreement with IOC or can issue an eviction notice followed by an  eviction suit.3. The lease agreement is valid, however without identifying your share in the proeprty you cannot ask the IOC to vacate becasue there is a valid registered lease agreement and that too it is effective for over 23 years till this date.4.

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property by HUF",
    "answer": "HUF stands for Hindu Undivided Family. It is a separate legal entity that can be formed by a Hindu family consisting of a common ancestor and his lineal descendants, along with their wives and unmarried daughters. A HUF can own property, run a business, invest in various assets, and file tax returns in its own name. A HUF has its own PAN and enjoys a separate basic tax exemption of Rs. 2.50 lakh in addition to the tax exemption of each of its members.To form a HUF, you need to follow these steps:Write an HUF deed on a stamp paper, stating the names of the HUF’s karta, coparceners and members. The karta is the senior-most male member who manages the affairs of the HUF. The coparceners are the male members who have a right to demand a share in the HUF property. The members are the female members and minor children who have a right to maintenance from the HUF.Apply for an HUF PAN card using Form 49A at the NSDL website.Open an HUF bank account.To transfer your property to your HUF, you need to execute a deed of assignment or gift in favour of your HUF, stating that you are transferring your individual rights in the property to your HUF as a gift or for consideration. You may have to pay stamp duty and registration charges on such transfer, depending on the state laws.When you sell the property as an HUF, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition or improvement of the property. The capital gains tax rate depends on whether the property is long-term or short-term, depending on the period of holding. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefit, while short-term capital gains are taxed at the normal slab rates applicable to the HUF. You can claim exemption from capital gains tax by investing the sale proceeds in another residential property or specified bonds under Section 54 or 54EC of the Income Tax Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "plot no. Mentioned in saatbara and sale deed  are different what is actual document of ownershipr",
    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Need citation stating that BBMP cannot issue Khatha for property that is under dispute and is in the",
    "answer": "Khatha is a document that records the details of a property owner in the records of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike). It is not a proof of ownership, but an evidence of assessment of property tax. Khatha can be issued, transferred, bifurcated or amalgamated by the BBMP based on the documents submitted by the property owner, such as sale deed, conversion order, layout plan, etc.However, the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for a property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. This is because the BBMP has to verify the validity and legality of the documents submitted by the property owner before issuing Khatha. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding the ownership or title of the property, the BBMP has to wait for the court’s decision before issuing Khatha.There are some citations that support this principle. For example, in Dr.S. Shobha vs The Commissioner Bbmp on 20 September, 2021, the Karnataka High Court held that:“The BBMP cannot issue khata in favour of any person without verifying the legality and validity of documents produced by such person. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding such documents, it is open for the BBMP to refuse to issue khata and direct such person to obtain a declaration of title from a competent court.”Similarly, in Here’s why BBMP Khata is not a proof of ownership for your property, it is stated that:“The Karnataka High Court has ruled that if there is any dispute regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without verifying all relevant documents and obtaining legal opinion from its legal cell. The Court also held that if there are any pending court cases regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without waiting for the outcome of such cases.” Citation: ILR2009KAR458, 2009 (3)KarLJ630 (and on the net in MANU/KA/0450/2008)Therefore, based on these citations, you can argue that the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for your property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. You can also submit copies of the court orders that have dismissed or stayed the claims of [PERSON 1]'s grandchildren as evidence of your title and possession.I hope this information helps you. I wish you all the best for your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property by HUF",
    "answer": "HUF stands for Hindu Undivided Family. It is a separate legal entity that can be formed by a Hindu family consisting of a common ancestor and his lineal descendants, along with their wives and unmarried daughters. A HUF can own property, run a business, invest in various assets, and file tax returns in its own name. A HUF has its own PAN and enjoys a separate basic tax exemption of Rs. 2.50 lakh in addition to the tax exemption of each of its members.To form a HUF, you need to follow these steps:Write an HUF deed on a stamp paper, stating the names of the HUF’s karta, coparceners and members. The karta is the senior-most male member who manages the affairs of the HUF. The coparceners are the male members who have a right to demand a share in the HUF property. The members are the female members and minor children who have a right to maintenance from the HUF.Apply for an HUF PAN card using Form 49A at the NSDL website.Open an HUF bank account.To transfer your property to your HUF, you need to execute a deed of assignment or gift in favour of your HUF, stating that you are transferring your individual rights in the property to your HUF as a gift or for consideration. You may have to pay stamp duty and registration charges on such transfer, depending on the state laws.When you sell the property as an HUF, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition or improvement of the property. The capital gains tax rate depends on whether the property is long-term or short-term, depending on the period of holding. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefit, while short-term capital gains are taxed at the normal slab rates applicable to the HUF. You can claim exemption from capital gains tax by investing the sale proceeds in another residential property or specified bonds under Section 54 or 54EC of the Income Tax Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Need citation stating that BBMP cannot issue Khatha for property that is under dispute and is in the",
    "answer": "Khatha is a document that records the details of a property owner in the records of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike). It is not a proof of ownership, but an evidence of assessment of property tax. Khatha can be issued, transferred, bifurcated or amalgamated by the BBMP based on the documents submitted by the property owner, such as sale deed, conversion order, layout plan, etc.However, the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for a property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. This is because the BBMP has to verify the validity and legality of the documents submitted by the property owner before issuing Khatha. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding the ownership or title of the property, the BBMP has to wait for the court’s decision before issuing Khatha.There are some citations that support this principle. For example, in Dr.S. Shobha vs The Commissioner Bbmp on 20 September, 2021, the Karnataka High Court held that:“The BBMP cannot issue khata in favour of any person without verifying the legality and validity of documents produced by such person. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding such documents, it is open for the BBMP to refuse to issue khata and direct such person to obtain a declaration of title from a competent court.”Similarly, in Here’s why BBMP Khata is not a proof of ownership for your property, it is stated that:“The Karnataka High Court has ruled that if there is any dispute regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without verifying all relevant documents and obtaining legal opinion from its legal cell. The Court also held that if there are any pending court cases regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without waiting for the outcome of such cases.” Citation: ILR2009KAR458, 2009 (3)KarLJ630 (and on the net in MANU/KA/0450/2008)Therefore, based on these citations, you can argue that the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for your property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. You can also submit copies of the court orders that have dismissed or stayed the claims of [PERSON 1]'s grandchildren as evidence of your title and possession.I hope this information helps you.

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership can be formed by an oral or written agreement between two or more persons. The registration of a partnership firm is not mandatory, but it has certain advantages and disadvantages. A registered partnership firm has legal recognition and can sue or be sued in its own name. An unregistered partnership firm, on the other hand, has certain limitations and disabilities, such as not being able to enforce its rights or obligations against third parties or other partners in a court of law.The legality of your father’s partnership firm may depend on the nature and terms of the agreement that he had with his friend. If there was a written partnership deed that clearly defined the roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing ratio of each partner, then it may be considered as a valid agreement between them. However, if there was no written partnership deed or if the partnership deed was vague or ambiguous, then it may be difficult to prove the existence and validity of the partnership in a court of law.The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, is an act that regulates the production, supply, and distribution of certain commodities that are essential for the public. The act empowers the central and state governments to issue licenses and permits for dealing with such commodities and to impose restrictions and penalties for violating the provisions of the act. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, is an act that governs the formation and enforcement of contracts in India. The act lays down the principles and rules for valid contracts, their performance, breach, and remedies.Your father’s partnership firm may be illegal under the Essential Commodities Act if it was dealing with fertilizers without a valid license issued by the state government. This may attract criminal liability and penalties under the act. Your father may also be liable under the Indian Contract Act if he breached any contractual obligations that he had with his customers or suppliers.Your claim for money due from your father’s partner may not be dismissed if you can prove that your father was a partner in the firm and that he had contributed capital and was entitled to a share of profits as per the partnership deed. You may also have to prove that your father’s partner owes him money as per the audited financial statements of the firm. You may have to file a civil suit for recovery of money against your father’s partner in the court of competent jurisdiction.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Partners cannot enforce rights or obligations under the partnership deed against third parties.As a consequence of the non-registration of the firm,a partnership firm cannot approach the legal authorities for help in case of any dispute or breach of contract. To do so, the firm or the concerned partner has to have its name registered with the Registrar of Firms.a partner of an erstwhile unregistered partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce a right arising out of a contract hit by the provision of section 69 or the partnership act .

This may need to be addressed separately from the partnership issue.Regarding the money your father is owed based on the partnership agreement, you may still have a valid claim for it. The partnership deed should outline the terms of capital contribution, remuneration, and profit-sharing.

    "question": "Higher education loan: reduction in maintenance",
    "answer": "Maintenance is the amount payable by the husband to his wife in case she is unable to maintain herself either during the subsistence of the marriage or upon separation and divorce. Maintenance should include necessarily include a provision for residence. The amount of maintenance given to a wife is determined by various factors, such as the parties’ position and status, legitimate needs of the claimant, the claimant’s property worth and any income received from it, or from the claimant’s own income, or from any other source.According to Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act,1955, the Applicant being either the husband or wife is entitled to receive his or her maintenance from the spouse in the form of a gross sum or monthly sum for a term not exceeding the lifetime of the applicant or until the applicant remarries. The court may vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the court may deem just if it appears to the court that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has been made.Therefore, if you take a loan for higher education, it may affect the amount of maintenance that you have to pay to your wife, depending on how it changes your income and expenses. The court may consider your education loan EMI as a factor while calculating maintenance, but it may not necessarily reduce the maintenance amount. The court may also look at other factors, such as your earning potential after completing your higher education, your wife’s financial needs and status, and the best interests of your children (if any).Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property by HUF",
    "answer": "HUF stands for Hindu Undivided Family. It is a separate legal entity that can be formed by a Hindu family consisting of a common ancestor and his lineal descendants, along with their wives and unmarried daughters. A HUF can own property, run a business, invest in various assets, and file tax returns in its own name. A HUF has its own PAN and enjoys a separate basic tax exemption of Rs. 2.50 lakh in addition to the tax exemption of each of its members.To form a HUF, you need to follow these steps:Write an HUF deed on a stamp paper, stating the names of the HUF’s karta, coparceners and members. The karta is the senior-most male member who manages the affairs of the HUF. The coparceners are the male members who have a right to demand a share in the HUF property. The members are the female members and minor children who have a right to maintenance from the HUF.Apply for an HUF PAN card using Form 49A at the NSDL website.Open an HUF bank account.To transfer your property to your HUF, you need to execute a deed of assignment or gift in favour of your HUF, stating that you are transferring your individual rights in the property to your HUF as a gift or for consideration. You may have to pay stamp duty and registration charges on such transfer, depending on the state laws.When you sell the property as an HUF, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition or improvement of the property. The capital gains tax rate depends on whether the property is long-term or short-term, depending on the period of holding. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefit, while short-term capital gains are taxed at the normal slab rates applicable to the HUF. You can claim exemption from capital gains tax by investing the sale proceeds in another residential property or specified bonds under Section 54 or 54EC of the Income Tax Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership can be formed by an oral or written agreement between two or more persons. The registration of a partnership firm is not mandatory, but it has certain advantages and disadvantages. A registered partnership firm has legal recognition and can sue or be sued in its own name. An unregistered partnership firm, on the other hand, has certain limitations and disabilities, such as not being able to enforce its rights or obligations against third parties or other partners in a court of law.The legality of your father’s partnership firm may depend on the nature and terms of the agreement that he had with his friend. If there was a written partnership deed that clearly defined the roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing ratio of each partner, then it may be considered as a valid agreement between them. However, if there was no written partnership deed or if the partnership deed was vague or ambiguous, then it may be difficult to prove the existence and validity of the partnership in a court of law.The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, is an act that regulates the production, supply, and distribution of certain commodities that are essential for the public. The act empowers the central and state governments to issue licenses and permits for dealing with such commodities and to impose restrictions and penalties for violating the provisions of the act. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, is an act that governs the formation and enforcement of contracts in India. The act lays down the principles and rules for valid contracts, their performance, breach, and remedies.Your father’s partnership firm may be illegal under the Essential Commodities Act if it was dealing with fertilizers without a valid license issued by the state government. This may attract criminal liability and penalties under the act. Your father may also be liable under the Indian Contract Act if he breached any contractual obligations that he had with his customers or suppliers.Your claim for money due from your father’s partner may not be dismissed if you can prove that your father was a partner in the firm and that he had contributed capital and was entitled to a share of profits as per the partnership deed. You may also have to prove that your father’s partner owes him money as per the audited financial statements of the firm. You may have to file a civil suit for recovery of money against your father’s partner in the court of competent jurisdiction.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

It cannot be used as evidence to settle disputes between partners or third parties in a court of law. Partners cannot enforce rights or obligations under the partnership deed against third parties.As a consequence of the non-registration of the firm,a partnership firm cannot approach the legal authorities for help in case of any dispute or breach of contract. To do so, the firm or the concerned partner has to have its name registered with the Registrar of Firms.a partner of an erstwhile unregistered partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce a right arising out of a contract hit by the provision of section 69 or the partnership act .

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Higher education loan: reduction in maintenance",
    "answer": "Maintenance is the amount payable by the husband to his wife in case she is unable to maintain herself either during the subsistence of the marriage or upon separation and divorce. Maintenance should include necessarily include a provision for residence. The amount of maintenance given to a wife is determined by various factors, such as the parties’ position and status, legitimate needs of the claimant, the claimant’s property worth and any income received from it, or from the claimant’s own income, or from any other source.According to Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act,1955, the Applicant being either the husband or wife is entitled to receive his or her maintenance from the spouse in the form of a gross sum or monthly sum for a term not exceeding the lifetime of the applicant or until the applicant remarries. The court may vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the court may deem just if it appears to the court that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has been made.Therefore, if you take a loan for higher education, it may affect the amount of maintenance that you have to pay to your wife, depending on how it changes your income and expenses. The court may consider your education loan EMI as a factor while calculating maintenance, but it may not necessarily reduce the maintenance amount. The court may also look at other factors, such as your earning potential after completing your higher education, your wife’s financial needs and status, and the best interests of your children (if any).Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership can be formed by an oral or written agreement between two or more persons. The registration of a partnership firm is not mandatory, but it has certain advantages and disadvantages. A registered partnership firm has legal recognition and can sue or be sued in its own name. An unregistered partnership firm, on the other hand, has certain limitations and disabilities, such as not being able to enforce its rights or obligations against third parties or other partners in a court of law.The legality of your father’s partnership firm may depend on the nature and terms of the agreement that he had with his friend. If there was a written partnership deed that clearly defined the roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing ratio of each partner, then it may be considered as a valid agreement between them. However, if there was no written partnership deed or if the partnership deed was vague or ambiguous, then it may be difficult to prove the existence and validity of the partnership in a court of law.The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, is an act that regulates the production, supply, and distribution of certain commodities that are essential for the public. The act empowers the central and state governments to issue licenses and permits for dealing with such commodities and to impose restrictions and penalties for violating the provisions of the act. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, is an act that governs the formation and enforcement of contracts in India. The act lays down the principles and rules for valid contracts, their performance, breach, and remedies.Your father’s partnership firm may be illegal under the Essential Commodities Act if it was dealing with fertilizers without a valid license issued by the state government. This may attract criminal liability and penalties under the act.

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "An unregistered partnership deed is still a valid agreement between the partners but has certain limitations. It cannot be used as evidence to settle disputes between partners or third parties in a court of law. Partners cannot enforce rights or obligations under the partnership deed against third parties.As a consequence of the non-registration of the firm,a partnership firm cannot approach the legal authorities for help in case of any dispute or breach of contract. To do so, the firm or the concerned partner has to have its name registered with the Registrar of Firms.a partner of an erstwhile unregistered partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce a right arising out of a contract hit by the provision of section 69 or the partnership act . However a suit by a partner to recover money from a third person is not barred by section 69 of the Act, if the transaction, involved in the suit, is in his own name only and the defendant had no notice of the existence of the partnershipT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "In India, partnerships can be registered or unregistered, and they are governed by the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. While it's ideal for partnerships to be registered, unregistered partnerships are not necessarily illegal.The fact that your father does not have a license for dealing in fertilizers may be a separate issue related to compliance with the Essential Commodities Act and other relevant regulations. This may need to be addressed separately from the partnership issue.Regarding the money your father is owed based on the partnership agreement, you may still have a valid claim for it. The partnership deed should outline the terms of capital contribution, remuneration, and profit-sharing. If your father's partner is not clearing the dues as per the agreement, your father may have legal recourse to recover the outstanding amount.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution. However, you may be able to get some benefits under the OBC category if your caste is listed as an OBC by the state or central government.You may also be able to pursue your legal challenge against the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before the Supreme Court or other competent authorities. However, this may take a long time and involve a lot of litigation and uncertainty.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Criminal Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in dealing with a forest offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This is a law that regulates the conservation and management of forests and forest produce in India. It also provides for the penalties and procedures for forest offences, such as cutting, uprooting, or damaging trees or plants without permission.The legal matters related to the compounding of forest offences are governed by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This section empowers the State Government to authorize a Forest Officer of a rank not inferior to that of a Ranger to accept a sum of money from a person who is suspected of committing a forest offence, other than an offence specified in Section 62 or Section 63 of the Act, as compensation for the offence. The Forest Officer can also release any property seized as liable to confiscation on payment of its value. On such payment, the suspected person and the property are discharged and no further proceedings are taken against them.Based on this section, I can try to answer your queries as follows:If the range officer compounds the above offence, it is unlikely that a more senior officer from the forest department can challenge or revoke this compounding on any grounds or challenge it in court. This is because Section 68(2) of the Act clearly states that no further proceedings shall be taken against the person or property once the compounding is done. Moreover, Section 69 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any forest offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder except on complaint made by certain authorities within six months from the date of commission of the offence. Therefore, unless there is any fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion involved in the compounding process, it is final and binding on both parties.If you compound the offence, it does not necessarily imply that you have admitted doing it. It only means that you have agreed to pay a sum of money as compensation for the offence that you are suspected of committing. It is possible that you may have done so to avoid further litigation and hassle, even though you are innocent. However, it may also affect your reputation and credibility, as it may create an impression that you are guilty or involved in some way. Whether your name will be recorded as an offender or a suspect in the database of the forest department depends on their internal policy and practice. You may request them to clarify this point before compounding the offence.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the range officer compounds the offense, it's typically a legally binding agreement, and it would usually not be challenged or revoked by a more senior officer unless there are strong grounds to do so, such as evidence of fraud or coercion in the compounding process. However, it's essential to consult with a legal expert in India for specific advice on your situation.Compounding an offense generally does not imply an admission of guilt. It is more like a settlement where you agree to pay a fine or compensation in exchange for avoiding a more extended legal process. Your name might be recorded as a party involved in the compounding process, but it doesn't necessarily label you as a convict.Regarding your additional questions:The compounding process is typically done by the forest officer empowered by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, not by the court. If you agree to pay the compensation, it is a voluntary agreement between you and the forest department.The reason compounding might not lead to acquittal for forest offenses is because the purpose of compounding is often to provide an expedited resolution and collect compensation for environmental damage, rather than a criminal trial leading to acquittal. Each offense and its legal implications can vary, so it's crucial to consult with a legal expert who can provide specific guidance based on your situation and the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in dealing with a forest offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This is a law that regulates the conservation and management of forests and forest produce in India. It also provides for the penalties and procedures for forest offences, such as cutting, uprooting, or damaging trees or plants without permission.The legal matters related to the compounding of forest offences are governed by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This section empowers the State Government to authorize a Forest Officer of a rank not inferior to that of a Ranger to accept a sum of money from a person who is suspected of committing a forest offence, other than an offence specified in Section 62 or Section 63 of the Act, as compensation for the offence. The Forest Officer can also release any property seized as liable to confiscation on payment of its value. On such payment, the suspected person and the property are discharged and no further proceedings are taken against them.Based on this section, I can try to answer your queries as follows:If the range officer compounds the above offence, it is unlikely that a more senior officer from the forest department can challenge or revoke this compounding on any grounds or challenge it in court. This is because Section 68(2) of the Act clearly states that no further proceedings shall be taken against the person or property once the compounding is done. Moreover, Section 69 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any forest offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder except on complaint made by certain authorities within six months from the date of commission of the offence. Therefore, unless there is any fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion involved in the compounding process, it is final and binding on both parties.If you compound the offence, it does not necessarily imply that you have admitted doing it. It only means that you have agreed to pay a sum of money as compensation for the offence that you are suspected of committing. It is possible that you may have done so to avoid further litigation and hassle, even though you are innocent. However, it may also affect your reputation and credibility, as it may create an impression that you are guilty or involved in some way. Whether your name will be recorded as an offender or a suspect in the database of the forest department depends on their internal policy and practice. You may request them to clarify this point before compounding the offence.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution.

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in dealing with a forest offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This is a law that regulates the conservation and management of forests and forest produce in India. It also provides for the penalties and procedures for forest offences, such as cutting, uprooting, or damaging trees or plants without permission.The legal matters related to the compounding of forest offences are governed by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This section empowers the State Government to authorize a Forest Officer of a rank not inferior to that of a Ranger to accept a sum of money from a person who is suspected of committing a forest offence, other than an offence specified in Section 62 or Section 63 of the Act, as compensation for the offence. The Forest Officer can also release any property seized as liable to confiscation on payment of its value. On such payment, the suspected person and the property are discharged and no further proceedings are taken against them.Based on this section, I can try to answer your queries as follows:If the range officer compounds the above offence, it is unlikely that a more senior officer from the forest department can challenge or revoke this compounding on any grounds or challenge it in court. This is because Section 68(2) of the Act clearly states that no further proceedings shall be taken against the person or property once the compounding is done. Moreover, Section 69 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any forest offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder except on complaint made by certain authorities within six months from the date of commission of the offence. Therefore, unless there is any fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion involved in the compounding process, it is final and binding on both parties.If you compound the offence, it does not necessarily imply that you have admitted doing it. It only means that you have agreed to pay a sum of money as compensation for the offence that you are suspected of committing. It is possible that you may have done so to avoid further litigation and hassle, even though you are innocent. However, it may also affect your reputation and credibility, as it may create an impression that you are guilty or involved in some way.

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the range officer compounds the offense, it's typically a legally binding agreement, and it would usually not be challenged or revoked by a more senior officer unless there are strong grounds to do so, such as evidence of fraud or coercion in the compounding process. However, it's essential to consult with a legal expert in India for specific advice on your situation.Compounding an offense generally does not imply an admission of guilt. It is more like a settlement where you agree to pay a fine or compensation in exchange for avoiding a more extended legal process. Your name might be recorded as a party involved in the compounding process, but it doesn't necessarily label you as a convict.Regarding your additional questions:The compounding process is typically done by the forest officer empowered by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, not by the court. If you agree to pay the compensation, it is a voluntary agreement between you and the forest department.The reason compounding might not lead to acquittal for forest offenses is because the purpose of compounding is often to provide an expedited resolution and collect compensation for environmental damage, rather than a criminal trial leading to acquittal. Each offense and its legal implications can vary, so it's crucial to consult with a legal expert who can provide specific guidance based on your situation and the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This section empowers the State Government to authorize a Forest Officer of a rank not inferior to that of a Ranger to accept a sum of money from a person who is suspected of committing a forest offence, other than an offence specified in Section 62 or Section 63 of the Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the range officer compounds the offense, it's typically a legally binding agreement, and it would usually not be challenged or revoked by a more senior officer unless there are strong grounds to do so, such as evidence of fraud or coercion in the compounding process. However, it's essential to consult with a legal expert in India for specific advice on your situation.Compounding an offense generally does not imply an admission of guilt. It is more like a settlement where you agree to pay a fine or compensation in exchange for avoiding a more extended legal process. Your name might be recorded as a party involved in the compounding process, but it doesn't necessarily label you as a convict.Regarding your additional questions:The compounding process is typically done by the forest officer empowered by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, not by the court. If you agree to pay the compensation, it is a voluntary agreement between you and the forest department.The reason compounding might not lead to acquittal for forest offenses is because the purpose of compounding is often to provide an expedited resolution and collect compensation for environmental damage, rather than a criminal trial leading to acquittal. Each offense and its legal implications can vary, so it's crucial to consult with a legal expert who can provide specific guidance based on your situation and the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution. However, you may be able to get some benefits under the OBC category if your caste is listed as an OBC by the state or central government.You may also be able to pursue your legal challenge against the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before the Supreme Court or other competent authorities. However, this may take a long time and involve a lot of litigation and uncertainty.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "You have been caught with alcohol in Bihar, where there is a complete prohibition of liquor since April 2016. According to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, any person who manufactures, bottles, distributes, transports, collects, stores, possesses, purchases, sells or consumes any intoxicant or liquor is liable to be punished with imprisonment and fine. The punishment may vary depending on the quantity of liquor involved and the number of offences committed. For example, if a person is caught with more than 5 litres of liquor for the first time, he may be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.You have been arrested and sent to jail for 44 hours before getting bail. This means that you have a criminal record which may affect your job prospects in the government sector. According to a Supreme Court judgment, a person facing criminal cases cannot be considered suitable for appointment in government service unless acquitted of the charges. The court also held that the employer has the right to verify the antecedents of the candidates and reject those who have criminal cases pending against them.Therefore, if you want to apply for a government job, you may have to disclose your criminal record and face the possibility of rejection. You may also have to undergo a background verification process which may include checking your court records and police records. You may also have to produce a certificate of good conduct from the authorities concerned.However, you have also mentioned that no one called you regarding the case for one year. This may mean that the case has not been pursued by the prosecution or that there is some delay or error in the judicial process.

    "question": "Can Overseas Indian citizen inherit property from father",
    "answer": "According to the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, an Overseas Indian citizen, who is a person of Indian origin (PIO) or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), can inherit any immovable property in India from anyone, including their relatives. The property can be residential, commercial, agricultural or a farmhouse. The NRI can inherit property in India even from another NRI, subject to certain conditions.The process to register the property in the son’s name after inheriting it from the father may vary depending on the state and the type of property. However, some general steps are as follows:Obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority or the court. This certificate establishes the relationship between the deceased and the legal heirs. It may require documents such as death certificate of the father, birth certificate of the son, identity proofs of the legal heirs, etc.Obtain a succession certificate from the court. This certificate grants the right to inherit the property to the legal heirs. It may require documents such as legal heir certificate, copy of the will (if any), affidavit by the legal heirs, etc.Transfer the title of the property in the son’s name by executing a relinquishment deed or a family settlement deed. These deeds are used to transfer the rights and interests of other legal heirs in favor of one heir. They have to be signed by all the legal heirs and attested by two witnesses. They also have to be stamped and registered with the sub-registrar of the area where the property is located.Pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property. The stamp duty and registration fees may vary depending on the state and the value of the property. They have to be paid online or offline before registering the deed.Update the revenue records of the property with the local authority or the revenue department. This is done to reflect the change in ownership and tax liability of the property. It may require documents such as copy of the registered deed, mutation application, identity proof of the son, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution. However, you may be able to get some benefits under the OBC category if your caste is listed as an OBC by the state or central government.You may also be able to pursue your legal challenge against the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before the Supreme Court or other competent authorities. However, this may take a long time and involve a lot of litigation and uncertainty.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Father is not allowing my mother to sell his gifted property",
    "answer": "According to theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can file for divorce on two grounds: mutual consent or contested divorce.Mutual consent divorceis when both spouses agree to end their marriage amicably and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, and property division. Contested divorce is when one spouse files for divorce without the consent of the other spouse on certain grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, mental disorder, etc.If your mother wants to file for a contested divorce, she will have to prove the ground on which she is seeking divorce in the court. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process. The procedure of contested divorce may vary depending on the location and the court where the petition is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of a petition: The spouse who wants to file for divorce has to prepare a petition stating the facts and grounds of the case. The petition has to be filed in the family court or district court where the spouses last resided together or where the marriage was solemnized.Service of notice: The court will issue a notice to the other spouse along with a copy of the petition. The other spouse has to file a written statement in response to the petition within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine the petition and the written statement and frame the issues that need to be decided in the case. The issues may relate to the grounds of divorce, alimony, child custody, property division, etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both spouses have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have to cross-examine each other and their witnesses in the court.Arguments and judgment: After the completion of evidence and cross-examination, both spouses have to present their arguments before the judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the divorce petition.The duration of a contested divorce may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a contested divorce to be finalized.If your mother wants to sell the gifted property that your father gave her, she will have to prove that she has a valid title over it. A gift deed is a legal document that describes the voluntary transfer of a property from a donor (owner of the property) to a donee (receiver of gift) without any monetary favor in return. The donor should not be insolvent and should not use this as a tool for evasion of tax and illegal gains.Registering a gift deed with the sub-registrar is mandatory under the laws in India (Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 and Section 123 of theTransfer of Property Act.) If this is not done, the transfer will be invalid. Once a gift deed is registered, only then the change in the title of ownership of property is possible.If your father is not allowing your mother to sell the gifted property, he may be challenging the validity of the gift deed or claiming that he has revoked it. A gift deed can be revoked by mutual consent of both parties or by rescinding it in a court of law on certain grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, mistake, etc.Your mother may have to file a suit for declaration and injunction in a civil court to assert her right over the gifted property and restrain your father from interfering with it. She will have to produce the registered gift deed and other documents to prove her title over it. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process.The procedure of filing a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the location and the court where it is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of plaint: The plaintiff (your mother) has to prepare a plaint stating the facts and relief sought in the case. The plaint has to be filed in the civil court having jurisdiction over the matter along with court fees and other documents.Service of summons: The court will issue summons to the defendant (your father) along with a copy of plaint. The defendant has to file a written statement in response to plaint within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine plaint and written statement and frame issues that need to be decided in case. The issues may relate to validity of gift deed, title over property, revocation of gift deed etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both parties have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have cross-examine each other and their witnesses in court.Arguments and judgment: After completion of evidence and cross-examination, both parties have to present their arguments before judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the suit.The duration of a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a suit to be finalized.I hope this information helps you understand the legal options available to you and your mother.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can Overseas Indian citizen inherit property from father",
    "answer": "According to the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, an Overseas Indian citizen, who is a person of Indian origin (PIO) or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), can inherit any immovable property in India from anyone, including their relatives. The property can be residential, commercial, agricultural or a farmhouse. The NRI can inherit property in India even from another NRI, subject to certain conditions.The process to register the property in the son’s name after inheriting it from the father may vary depending on the state and the type of property. However, some general steps are as follows:Obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority or the court. This certificate establishes the relationship between the deceased and the legal heirs. It may require documents such as death certificate of the father, birth certificate of the son, identity proofs of the legal heirs, etc.Obtain a succession certificate from the court. This certificate grants the right to inherit the property to the legal heirs. It may require documents such as legal heir certificate, copy of the will (if any), affidavit by the legal heirs, etc.Transfer the title of the property in the son’s name by executing a relinquishment deed or a family settlement deed. These deeds are used to transfer the rights and interests of other legal heirs in favor of one heir. They have to be signed by all the legal heirs and attested by two witnesses. They also have to be stamped and registered with the sub-registrar of the area where the property is located.Pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property. The stamp duty and registration fees may vary depending on the state and the value of the property. They have to be paid online or offline before registering the deed.Update the revenue records of the property with the local authority or the revenue department. This is done to reflect the change in ownership and tax liability of the property. It may require documents such as copy of the registered deed, mutation application, identity proof of the son, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Father is not allowing my mother to sell his gifted property",
    "answer": "According to theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can file for divorce on two grounds: mutual consent or contested divorce.Mutual consent divorceis when both spouses agree to end their marriage amicably and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, and property division. Contested divorce is when one spouse files for divorce without the consent of the other spouse on certain grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, mental disorder, etc.If your mother wants to file for a contested divorce, she will have to prove the ground on which she is seeking divorce in the court. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process. The procedure of contested divorce may vary depending on the location and the court where the petition is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of a petition: The spouse who wants to file for divorce has to prepare a petition stating the facts and grounds of the case. The petition has to be filed in the family court or district court where the spouses last resided together or where the marriage was solemnized.Service of notice: The court will issue a notice to the other spouse along with a copy of the petition. The other spouse has to file a written statement in response to the petition within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine the petition and the written statement and frame the issues that need to be decided in the case. The issues may relate to the grounds of divorce, alimony, child custody, property division, etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both spouses have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have to cross-examine each other and their witnesses in the court.Arguments and judgment: After the completion of evidence and cross-examination, both spouses have to present their arguments before the judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the divorce petition.The duration of a contested divorce may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a contested divorce to be finalized.If your mother wants to sell the gifted property that your father gave her, she will have to prove that she has a valid title over it. A gift deed is a legal document that describes the voluntary transfer of a property from a donor (owner of the property) to a donee (receiver of gift) without any monetary favor in return. The donor should not be insolvent and should not use this as a tool for evasion of tax and illegal gains.Registering a gift deed with the sub-registrar is mandatory under the laws in India (Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 and Section 123 of theTransfer of Property Act.) If this is not done, the transfer will be invalid. Once a gift deed is registered, only then the change in the title of ownership of property is possible.If your father is not allowing your mother to sell the gifted property, he may be challenging the validity of the gift deed or claiming that he has revoked it. A gift deed can be revoked by mutual consent of both parties or by rescinding it in a court of law on certain grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, mistake, etc.Your mother may have to file a suit for declaration and injunction in a civil court to assert her right over the gifted property and restrain your father from interfering with it. She will have to produce the registered gift deed and other documents to prove her title over it. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process.The procedure of filing a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the location and the court where it is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of plaint: The plaintiff (your mother) has to prepare a plaint stating the facts and relief sought in the case. The plaint has to be filed in the civil court having jurisdiction over the matter along with court fees and other documents.Service of summons: The court will issue summons to the defendant (your father) along with a copy of plaint. The defendant has to file a written statement in response to plaint within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine plaint and written statement and frame issues that need to be decided in case. The issues may relate to validity of gift deed, title over property, revocation of gift deed etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both parties have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations.

    "answer": "A will is a legal document that expresses the wishes of a person regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will is valid only if it is made by a person who is of sound mind and free from undue influence, fraud or coercion. A will is also valid only if it is attested by two or more witnesses who are not beneficiaries under the will.In your case, since your uncle’s will has given you and your brothers the first floor rooms and your cousins the ground floor and land, you have to respect his wishes and abide by his will. You do not have any right on the land unless your uncle has given you any such right in his will or by any other means. However, you have some rights as the first floor owner, such as:The right to use and enjoy your property without any interference or disturbance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to repair and maintain your property as per your needs and preferences.The right to access and exit your property through the common staircase, passage or road without any obstruction or hindrance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to claim a share in the common expenses and amenities such as water, electricity, security, etc., that are incurred for the benefit of the entire building.The right to seek partition of the building if you are not satisfied with the arrangement or if there is any dispute or conflict with your cousins or anyone else.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Caught with 2 Litre Alcohol in Bihar & Completed 44 hrs Jail term in Central Jail Purnia",
    "answer": "You have been caught with alcohol in Bihar, where there is a complete prohibition of liquor since April 2016. According to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, any person who manufactures, bottles, distributes, transports, collects, stores, possesses, purchases, sells or consumes any intoxicant or liquor is liable to be punished with imprisonment and fine. The punishment may vary depending on the quantity of liquor involved and the number of offences committed. For example, if a person is caught with more than 5 litres of liquor for the first time, he may be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.You have been arrested and sent to jail for 44 hours before getting bail. This means that you have a criminal record which may affect your job prospects in the government sector. According to a Supreme Court judgment, a person facing criminal cases cannot be considered suitable for appointment in government service unless acquitted of the charges. The court also held that the employer has the right to verify the antecedents of the candidates and reject those who have criminal cases pending against them.Therefore, if you want to apply for a government job, you may have to disclose your criminal record and face the possibility of rejection. You may also have to undergo a background verification process which may include checking your court records and police records. You may also have to produce a certificate of good conduct from the authorities concerned.However, you have also mentioned that no one called you regarding the case for one year. This may mean that the case has not been pursued by the prosecution or that there is some delay or error in the judicial process.

    "question": "Order 21 Rule 2 clarification after yesterday's post",
    "answer": "The remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to whether there was a valid compromise or  not. This is so because a consent decree is nothing but contract between parties superimposed with the seal of  approval of the court. The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the agreement or compromise on which it is made.Finality of decisions is an underlying principle of all adjudicating forums. Thus, creation of further litigation should never be the basis of a compromise between the parties. Rule 3-A Order 23 CPC put a specific bar that no suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful. The scheme of Order 23 Rule 3 CPC is to avoid multiplicity of litigation and permit parties to amicably come to a settlement which is lawful, is in writing and a voluntary act on the part of the parties. The court can be instrumental in having an agreed compromise effected and finality attached to the same. The court should never be party to imposition of a compromise upon an unwilling party, still open to be questioned on an application under theproviso to Order 23 Rule 3 CPC before the court.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Order 21 Rule 2 clarification after yesterday's post",
    "answer": "The remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to whether there was a valid compromise or  not. This is so because a consent decree is nothing but contract between parties superimposed with the seal of  approval of the court. The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the agreement or compromise on which it is made.Finality of decisions is an underlying principle of all adjudicating forums. Thus, creation of further litigation should never be the basis of a compromise between the parties. Rule 3-A Order 23 CPC put a specific bar that no suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful. The scheme of Order 23 Rule 3 CPC is to avoid multiplicity of litigation and permit parties to amicably come to a settlement which is lawful, is in writing and a voluntary act on the part of the parties. The court can be instrumental in having an agreed compromise effected and finality attached to the same. The court should never be party to imposition of a compromise upon an unwilling party, still open to be questioned on an application under theproviso to Order 23 Rule 3 CPC before the court.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Recovery of joining bonus in case I resign before 1 year",
    "answer": "The clause in your offer letter means that if you resign from your job within one year of your date of joining, you will have to pay back the entire amount of the joining bonus to your employer. The joining bonus is a sum of money paid to you by your employer as an incentive for joining their company. It is usually subject to taxes and deductions as per the applicable laws and regulations. However, if you leave your job before completing a certain period of service, the bonus may be recovered by your employer as a penalty for breaching the contract.The term “resign” means to voluntarily quit or leave your job. It does not matter whether you serve the notice period or not, as long as you initiate the termination of your employment contract. Therefore, even if you serve more than a year in total, including the notice period, you will still be liable to pay back the joining bonus if you resign within one year of your date of joining.For example, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 3rd October 2023, you will have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned within one year of your date of joining (12th December 2022 to 11th December 2023). However, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 12th December 2023 or later, you will not have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is before 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned after completing one year of service.This is the general interpretation of the clause based on the common usage and meaning of the words. However, there may be some variations and exceptions depending on the specific terms and conditions of your employment contract, the policies and practices of your employer, and the laws and regulations governing labour and taxation in your jurisdiction. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before taking any action based on this information.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

During this notice period, you are usually still considered an employee, and you may be expected to continue performing your job responsibilities, unless your employer chooses to relieve you of your duties immediately and pay you in lieu of notice.So, you do not have to pay joining bonus back to your company and if they ask you to do so then that is not tenable in the eyes of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "You have been caught with alcohol in Bihar, where there is a complete prohibition of liquor since April 2016. According to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, any person who manufactures, bottles, distributes, transports, collects, stores, possesses, purchases, sells or consumes any intoxicant or liquor is liable to be punished with imprisonment and fine. The punishment may vary depending on the quantity of liquor involved and the number of offences committed. For example, if a person is caught with more than 5 litres of liquor for the first time, he may be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.You have been arrested and sent to jail for 44 hours before getting bail. This means that you have a criminal record which may affect your job prospects in the government sector. According to a Supreme Court judgment, a person facing criminal cases cannot be considered suitable for appointment in government service unless acquitted of the charges. The court also held that the employer has the right to verify the antecedents of the candidates and reject those who have criminal cases pending against them.Therefore, if you want to apply for a government job, you may have to disclose your criminal record and face the possibility of rejection. You may also have to undergo a background verification process which may include checking your court records and police records. You may also have to produce a certificate of good conduct from the authorities concerned.However, you have also mentioned that no one called you regarding the case for one year. This may mean that the case has not been pursued by the prosecution or that there is some delay or error in the judicial process.

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "The courts generally do not entertain the execution of RCR decree for attachment of property.Besides the attachment of property on your name cannot be done just like that i.e., at least not in the manner that you say.You should have a control over your anxiety.The court cannot pass an order to attach the property without knowing that the property is on your name, hence it will pass an order to the District collector, who in turn will instruct the concerned Revenue office to produce the list of immovable properties lying on your name.After that also the process is cumbersome.As far as RCR decree is concerned the HMA itself provides that the person presenting petition cannot take advantage of his/her own wrong to get a decree in her favor.  As far as the respondent case is  concerned very lengthy arguments have taken place that RCR provision itself is violation of Article 21 ofConstitution of Indiaand there are many case laws to that effect.  In my view  it is not possible to enforce RCR decree by any other method because it is your  right to choose between joining her or not joining her.. RCR is only a directional decree not an compelling decree.Therefore you may not be worried to the extent what you have expressed here in this regard.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. It is available under various personal laws in India, such as theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936.If a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsis passed by the court and the respondent does not comply with it within one year, the petitioner can file an application for attachment and sale of the respondent’s property under Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court may order the attachment of any movable or immovable property of the respondent and direct its sale after six months of attachment. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the court may award such compensation to the petitioner as it thinks fit and pay the balance to the respondent.However, the court has to consider various factors before ordering the attachment and sale of property, such as the nature and value of the property, the income and expenses of both parties, the hardship caused to the respondent, and the possibility of reconciliation. The court also has to ensure that the attachment and sale of property is not oppressive or excessive and does not violate the fundamental rights of the respondent. The court has to balance the interests of both parties and act in accordance with justice, equity and good conscience.Therefore, in your case, it is not certain that the court will order the attachment and sale of your movable property worth 17L as compensation for non-compliance of RCR decree. It will depend on the facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider other modes of execution, such as imprisonment or community service. The amount of compensation awarded by the court may vary from case to case depending on various factors. There is no fixed formula or standard for determining the compensation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

A will is valid only if it is made by a person who is of sound mind and free from undue influence, fraud or coercion. A will is also valid only if it is attested by two or more witnesses who are not beneficiaries under the will.In your case, since your uncle’s will has given you and your brothers the first floor rooms and your cousins the ground floor and land, you have to respect his wishes and abide by his will.

    "question": "Requirement of recording the compromise entered in lok adalat",
    "answer": "The Compromise entered in Lok Adalat , whether falls under “Compromise Out of Court”A compromise entered in Lok Adalat does not fall under the category of “compromise out of court”. A compromise out of court is a settlement between the parties without the intervention or approval of the court. A compromise in Lok Adalat, on the other hand, is a settlement between the parties with the assistance and consent of the Lok Adalat, which is a statutory body under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. A compromise in Lok Adalat has the same effect as a decree of a civil court and is binding and final on the parties. Therefore, a compromise in Lok Adalat is different from a compromise out of court.Whether such compromise (Considering out of Court) requires to be recorded before Executing Court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides that where any money payable under a decree of any kind is paid out of court or where any property movable or immovable is transferred by any party to a suit to another in satisfaction of his claim under such decree, such payment or transfer shall be certified to the court whose duty it is to execute such decree. However, this rule does not apply to a compromise in Lok Adalat, as it is not a payment or transfer out of court, but a settlement in Lok Adalat. Moreover, as per Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a civil court and shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and no appeal shall lie to any court against such award. Therefore, such compromise does not require to be recorded before executing court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.If reply is “yes” from Experts…then How to satisfy the Executing Court, In view of settled law of SC cited above.Since the reply is “no” from me, this question does not arise. However, if you still want to know how to satisfy the executing court in case of a compromise in Lok Adalat, you may have to produce the award or certificate issued by the Lok Adalat before the executing court and seek its execution as per Order 21 Rule 11 CPC. You may also have to show that there was no fraud or coercion involved in the compromise and that it was voluntary and lawful. However, you should consult a lawyer and follow his or her advice before taking any action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can I change my name in patta after my sisters gave up her consent through relinquishment in my name",
    "answer": "The property that belonged to your deceased grandfather shall devolve equally on all his own legal heirs. If there was a partition between the siblings of your father and has been done by a registered deed, then the share of property of your father shall become your father's own and absolute property which can be considered as his self acquired property.If your father is also reported to have died intestate subsequently then his share shall devolve equally on his own legal heirs which includes your mother.In this given situation, even though your siblings and your mother give NOC to the revenue department to transfer your father's name in the patta of  the property and get it transferred to your name alone, it cannot be considered as a proper transfer until and unless your siblings and your mother execute a registered release deed relinquishing their rights in the property.  You will become an absolute owner of the entire share of your father in the property only after the above process is completed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Can I change my name in patta after my sisters gave up her consent through relinquishment in my name",
    "answer": "A patta is a legal document that records the ownership of land and the details of the land such as area, location, survey number, etc. A patta is issued by the Revenue Department of the state government and it is an important evidence of title to the land.A relinquishment deed is a legal document that records the transfer of rights or interest in a property by one co-owner or co-sharer to another co-owner or co-sharer. A relinquishment deed is executed by the transferor in favour of the transferee and it is registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances under the Registration Act, 1908.If your sisters have given their consent to relinquish their share in your grandfather’s property in your name in 2014, then you can change your name in patta after completing the following steps:Obtain a certified copy of the relinquishment deed from the Sub-Registrar’s office where it was registered.Apply for mutation of patta in your name with the Revenue Department of your district. Mutation is the process of changing the name of the owner in the revenue records after a transfer of property. You will have to submit an application form along with the required documents such as copy of relinquishment deed, copy of patta, copy of Aadhaar card, etc. You will also have to pay a nominal fee for mutation.After verifying your documents and conducting a field survey, the Revenue Department will issue a new patta in your name with the updated details of the property.You can also apply for online mutation of patta through the Online Services portal of Revenue & Disaster Management Department, Government of Odisha.

    "question": "Dispute on legal agreement with IOC",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are answers to your questions regarding the dispute on the legal agreement with IOC:Will this lease agreement be valid?The validity of the lease agreement depends on whether Vijay had the authority and consent of all the co-owners of the land to enter into such an agreement with IOC. If Vijay had obtained the power of attorney from Govind and Raj and also informed Guna about the lease agreement, then the lease agreement may be valid. However, if Vijay had acted without the consent or knowledge of Guna or you, then the lease agreement may be invalid and voidable. You can challenge the validity of the lease agreement in court on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, or breach of trust by Vijay.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. However, you may face difficulties in doing so, as IOC may claim that they are bona fide lessees who have paid rent and invested in the property in good faith. IOC may also claim that they are not aware of any dispute or defect in Vijay's title or authority to lease the land. You may have to prove that IOC had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay was not authorized to lease the land without your consent.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can also ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. Similar to IOC, the dealer may claim to be a sub-lessee or licensee of IOC who has acted in good faith. You may need to prove that the dealer had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay or IOC lacked the authority to lease the land without your consent.How to proceed with Vijay, who entered into a lease agreement with IOC without Guna?You can proceed against Vijay by sending him a legal notice or filing a suit for declaration and cancellation of the lease agreement in court. You can also claim damages for breach of trust and loss of income from Vijay. Seeking an injunction to restrain Vijay from interfering with your possession and enjoyment of your share of the land is an option as well.How to proceed further without going to court, like sending a letter of my own to IOC, the dealer, and Vijay?You can attempt to resolve the matter amicably by sending a letter explaining your situation and requesting them to vacate the petrol pump within a reasonable time. Offering some compensation for their investment and inconvenience might facilitate a resolution. However, if they refuse to cooperate or negotiate, you may need to seek legal assistance and pursue legal action.How to proceed further with a lawyer/court?To proceed further with a lawyer and court, you should consider hiring a lawyer experienced in property law and lease agreements. Consult with the lawyer to get advice on the best course of action. Discuss legal fees, expected timelines, and the likelihood of success for your case. Be prepared to provide all relevant documents and evidence to support your case, including Guna's registered document, the lease agreement between Vijay and IOC, the RTI reply from IOC, and any other pertinent records. Maintain communication with your lawyer to stay informed about case progress and outcomes.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. The lease agreement entered between IOC and Vijay is valid to the etent of Vijay's share at the time of entering into the lease agreement, however it appears that Guna has not raise any objection or had claimed a share out of the rental amount all through his lifetime after purchasing the 1/6th common share in the property.  However  it cannot be said that the lease agreement is invalid.2. Since Guna's share in the property has not been divided yet, the legal heirs of Guna can file a suit for partition and for separate possession of their share in the property. After that the legal heirs of deceased Guna can either continue the leas agreement by entering into a fresh lease agreement with IOC or can issue an eviction notice followed by an  eviction suit.3. The lease agreement is valid, however without identifying your share in the proeprty you cannot ask the IOC to vacate becasue there is a valid registered lease agreement and that too it is effective for over 23 years till this date.4. Suit for partition, read the answer given in point 2 above.5. You cannot solve the problem without involving legal steps.6.

A will is valid only if it is made by a person who is of sound mind and free from undue influence, fraud or coercion. A will is also valid only if it is attested by two or more witnesses who are not beneficiaries under the will.In your case, since your uncle’s will has given you and your brothers the first floor rooms and your cousins the ground floor and land, you have to respect his wishes and abide by his will. You do not have any right on the land unless your uncle has given you any such right in his will or by any other means. However, you have some rights as the first floor owner, such as:The right to use and enjoy your property without any interference or disturbance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to repair and maintain your property as per your needs and preferences.The right to access and exit your property through the common staircase, passage or road without any obstruction or hindrance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to claim a share in the common expenses and amenities such as water, electricity, security, etc., that are incurred for the benefit of the entire building.The right to seek partition of the building if you are not satisfied with the arrangement or if there is any dispute or conflict with your cousins or anyone else.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, this rule does not apply to a compromise in Lok Adalat, as it is not a payment or transfer out of court, but a settlement in Lok Adalat. Moreover, as per Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a civil court and shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and no appeal shall lie to any court against such award. Therefore, such compromise does not require to be recorded before executing court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.If reply is “yes” from Experts…then How to satisfy the Executing Court, In view of settled law of SC cited above.Since the reply is “no” from me, this question does not arise. However, if you still want to know how to satisfy the executing court in case of a compromise in Lok Adalat, you may have to produce the award or certificate issued by the Lok Adalat before the executing court and seek its execution as per Order 21 Rule 11 CPC. You may also have to show that there was no fraud or coercion involved in the compromise and that it was voluntary and lawful. However, you should consult a lawyer and follow his or her advice before taking any action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. It is available under various personal laws in India, such as theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936.If a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsis passed by the court and the respondent does not comply with it within one year, the petitioner can file an application for attachment and sale of the respondent’s property under Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court may order the attachment of any movable or immovable property of the respondent and direct its sale after six months of attachment. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the court may award such compensation to the petitioner as it thinks fit and pay the balance to the respondent.However, the court has to consider various factors before ordering the attachment and sale of property, such as the nature and value of the property, the income and expenses of both parties, the hardship caused to the respondent, and the possibility of reconciliation. The court also has to ensure that the attachment and sale of property is not oppressive or excessive and does not violate the fundamental rights of the respondent. The court has to balance the interests of both parties and act in accordance with justice, equity and good conscience.Therefore, in your case, it is not certain that the court will order the attachment and sale of your movable property worth 17L as compensation for non-compliance of RCR decree. It will depend on the facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider other modes of execution, such as imprisonment or community service. The amount of compensation awarded by the court may vary from case to case depending on various factors. There is no fixed formula or standard for determining the compensation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding orders for IA petition",
    "answer": "An IA petition is an interlocutory application, which is an application moved in the main petition for some urgent relief or to bring some new facts to the notice of the court. An interlocutory order is an order passed in such an application, which is not final and is subject to change or modification. The procedure for filing and hearing an IA petition is the same as that of the original suit, in matters like recording of evidence, examining witnesses, etc.According to Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the High Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. Similarly, the District Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. The transfer of a case from one court to another may be done for various reasons, such as convenience of parties, speedy disposal of justice, impartiality of judges, etc.In your case, since your IA petition was transferred from one court to another due to the absence of a judge in the original court, and since the arguments were done again in the new court and it is posted for orders now, it is likely that the orders will be passed in the new court where the arguments are over. However, this may also depend on the discretion of the High Court or the District Court that has the power to transfer your case. If they decide to transfer your case back to the original court where a judge is appointed now, then you may have to argue your case again before that judge. Therefore, you should consult your lawyer and follow the updates on your case status.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

A will is valid only if it is made by a person who is of sound mind and free from undue influence, fraud or coercion. A will is also valid only if it is attested by two or more witnesses who are not beneficiaries under the will.In your case, since your uncle’s will has given you and your brothers the first floor rooms and your cousins the ground floor and land, you have to respect his wishes and abide by his will. You do not have any right on the land unless your uncle has given you any such right in his will or by any other means. However, you have some rights as the first floor owner, such as:The right to use and enjoy your property without any interference or disturbance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to repair and maintain your property as per your needs and preferences.The right to access and exit your property through the common staircase, passage or road without any obstruction or hindrance from your cousins or anyone else.The right to claim a share in the common expenses and amenities such as water, electricity, security, etc., that are incurred for the benefit of the entire building.The right to seek partition of the building if you are not satisfied with the arrangement or if there is any dispute or conflict with your cousins or anyone else.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding orders for IA petition",
    "answer": "An IA petition is an interlocutory application, which is an application moved in the main petition for some urgent relief or to bring some new facts to the notice of the court. An interlocutory order is an order passed in such an application, which is not final and is subject to change or modification. The procedure for filing and hearing an IA petition is the same as that of the original suit, in matters like recording of evidence, examining witnesses, etc.According to Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the High Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. Similarly, the District Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. The transfer of a case from one court to another may be done for various reasons, such as convenience of parties, speedy disposal of justice, impartiality of judges, etc.In your case, since your IA petition was transferred from one court to another due to the absence of a judge in the original court, and since the arguments were done again in the new court and it is posted for orders now, it is likely that the orders will be passed in the new court where the arguments are over. However, this may also depend on the discretion of the High Court or the District Court that has the power to transfer your case. If they decide to transfer your case back to the original court where a judge is appointed now, then you may have to argue your case again before that judge. Therefore, you should consult your lawyer and follow the updates on your case status.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "The courts generally do not entertain the execution of RCR decree for attachment of property.Besides the attachment of property on your name cannot be done just like that i.e., at least not in the manner that you say.You should have a control over your anxiety.The court cannot pass an order to attach the property without knowing that the property is on your name, hence it will pass an order to the District collector, who in turn will instruct the concerned Revenue office to produce the list of immovable properties lying on your name.After that also the process is cumbersome.As far as RCR decree is concerned the HMA itself provides that the person presenting petition cannot take advantage of his/her own wrong to get a decree in her favor.  As far as the respondent case is  concerned very lengthy arguments have taken place that RCR provision itself is violation of Article 21 ofConstitution of Indiaand there are many case laws to that effect.  In my view  it is not possible to enforce RCR decree by any other method because it is your  right to choose between joining her or not joining her.. RCR is only a directional decree not an compelling decree.Therefore you may not be worried to the extent what you have expressed here in this regard.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. It is available under various personal laws in India, such as theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936.If a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsis passed by the court and the respondent does not comply with it within one year, the petitioner can file an application for attachment and sale of the respondent’s property under Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court may order the attachment of any movable or immovable property of the respondent and direct its sale after six months of attachment. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the court may award such compensation to the petitioner as it thinks fit and pay the balance to the respondent.However, the court has to consider various factors before ordering the attachment and sale of property, such as the nature and value of the property, the income and expenses of both parties, the hardship caused to the respondent, and the possibility of reconciliation. The court also has to ensure that the attachment and sale of property is not oppressive or excessive and does not violate the fundamental rights of the respondent. The court has to balance the interests of both parties and act in accordance with justice, equity and good conscience.Therefore, in your case, it is not certain that the court will order the attachment and sale of your movable property worth 17L as compensation for non-compliance of RCR decree. It will depend on the facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider other modes of execution, such as imprisonment or community service. The amount of compensation awarded by the court may vary from case to case depending on various factors. There is no fixed formula or standard for determining the compensation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Requirement of recording the compromise entered in lok adalat",
    "answer": "The Compromise entered in Lok Adalat , whether falls under “Compromise Out of Court”A compromise entered in Lok Adalat does not fall under the category of “compromise out of court”. A compromise out of court is a settlement between the parties without the intervention or approval of the court. A compromise in Lok Adalat, on the other hand, is a settlement between the parties with the assistance and consent of the Lok Adalat, which is a statutory body under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. A compromise in Lok Adalat has the same effect as a decree of a civil court and is binding and final on the parties. Therefore, a compromise in Lok Adalat is different from a compromise out of court.Whether such compromise (Considering out of Court) requires to be recorded before Executing Court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides that where any money payable under a decree of any kind is paid out of court or where any property movable or immovable is transferred by any party to a suit to another in satisfaction of his claim under such decree, such payment or transfer shall be certified to the court whose duty it is to execute such decree. However, this rule does not apply to a compromise in Lok Adalat, as it is not a payment or transfer out of court, but a settlement in Lok Adalat. Moreover, as per Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a civil court and shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and no appeal shall lie to any court against such award. Therefore, such compromise does not require to be recorded before executing court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.If reply is “yes” from Experts…then How to satisfy the Executing Court, In view of settled law of SC cited above.Since the reply is “no” from me, this question does not arise. However, if you still want to know how to satisfy the executing court in case of a compromise in Lok Adalat, you may have to produce the award or certificate issued by the Lok Adalat before the executing court and seek its execution as per Order 21 Rule 11 CPC. You may also have to show that there was no fraud or coercion involved in the compromise and that it was voluntary and lawful. However, you should consult a lawyer and follow his or her advice before taking any action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding orders for IA petition",
    "answer": "An IA petition is an interlocutory application, which is an application moved in the main petition for some urgent relief or to bring some new facts to the notice of the court. An interlocutory order is an order passed in such an application, which is not final and is subject to change or modification. The procedure for filing and hearing an IA petition is the same as that of the original suit, in matters like recording of evidence, examining witnesses, etc.According to Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the High Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. Similarly, the District Court may transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same. The transfer of a case from one court to another may be done for various reasons, such as convenience of parties, speedy disposal of justice, impartiality of judges, etc.In your case, since your IA petition was transferred from one court to another due to the absence of a judge in the original court, and since the arguments were done again in the new court and it is posted for orders now, it is likely that the orders will be passed in the new court where the arguments are over. However, this may also depend on the discretion of the High Court or the District Court that has the power to transfer your case. If they decide to transfer your case back to the original court where a judge is appointed now, then you may have to argue your case again before that judge. Therefore, you should consult your lawyer and follow the updates on your case status.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Dispute on legal agreement with IOC",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are answers to your questions regarding the dispute on the legal agreement with IOC:Will this lease agreement be valid?The validity of the lease agreement depends on whether Vijay had the authority and consent of all the co-owners of the land to enter into such an agreement with IOC. If Vijay had obtained the power of attorney from Govind and Raj and also informed Guna about the lease agreement, then the lease agreement may be valid. However, if Vijay had acted without the consent or knowledge of Guna or you, then the lease agreement may be invalid and voidable. You can challenge the validity of the lease agreement in court on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, or breach of trust by Vijay.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. However, you may face difficulties in doing so, as IOC may claim that they are bona fide lessees who have paid rent and invested in the property in good faith. IOC may also claim that they are not aware of any dispute or defect in Vijay's title or authority to lease the land. You may have to prove that IOC had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay was not authorized to lease the land without your consent.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can also ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. Similar to IOC, the dealer may claim to be a sub-lessee or licensee of IOC who has acted in good faith. You may need to prove that the dealer had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay or IOC lacked the authority to lease the land without your consent.How to proceed with Vijay, who entered into a lease agreement with IOC without Guna?You can proceed against Vijay by sending him a legal notice or filing a suit for declaration and cancellation of the lease agreement in court. You can also claim damages for breach of trust and loss of income from Vijay. Seeking an injunction to restrain Vijay from interfering with your possession and enjoyment of your share of the land is an option as well.How to proceed further without going to court, like sending a letter of my own to IOC, the dealer, and Vijay?You can attempt to resolve the matter amicably by sending a letter explaining your situation and requesting them to vacate the petrol pump within a reasonable time. Offering some compensation for their investment and inconvenience might facilitate a resolution. However, if they refuse to cooperate or negotiate, you may need to seek legal assistance and pursue legal action.How to proceed further with a lawyer/court?To proceed further with a lawyer and court, you should consider hiring a lawyer experienced in property law and lease agreements. Consult with the lawyer to get advice on the best course of action. Discuss legal fees, expected timelines, and the likelihood of success for your case. Be prepared to provide all relevant documents and evidence to support your case, including Guna's registered document, the lease agreement between Vijay and IOC, the RTI reply from IOC, and any other pertinent records. Maintain communication with your lawyer to stay informed about case progress and outcomes.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. The lease agreement entered between IOC and Vijay is valid to the etent of Vijay's share at the time of entering into the lease agreement, however it appears that Guna has not raise any objection or had claimed a share out of the rental amount all through his lifetime after purchasing the 1/6th common share in the property.  However  it cannot be said that the lease agreement is invalid.2. Since Guna's share in the property has not been divided yet, the legal heirs of Guna can file a suit for partition and for separate possession of their share in the property. After that the legal heirs of deceased Guna can either continue the leas agreement by entering into a fresh lease agreement with IOC or can issue an eviction notice followed by an  eviction suit.3. The lease agreement is valid, however without identifying your share in the proeprty you cannot ask the IOC to vacate becasue there is a valid registered lease agreement and that too it is effective for over 23 years till this date.4. Suit for partition, read the answer given in point 2 above.5. You cannot solve the problem without involving legal steps.6.

    "question": "Requirement of recording the compromise entered in lok adalat",
    "answer": "The Compromise entered in Lok Adalat , whether falls under “Compromise Out of Court”A compromise entered in Lok Adalat does not fall under the category of “compromise out of court”. A compromise out of court is a settlement between the parties without the intervention or approval of the court. A compromise in Lok Adalat, on the other hand, is a settlement between the parties with the assistance and consent of the Lok Adalat, which is a statutory body under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. A compromise in Lok Adalat has the same effect as a decree of a civil court and is binding and final on the parties. Therefore, a compromise in Lok Adalat is different from a compromise out of court.Whether such compromise (Considering out of Court) requires to be recorded before Executing Court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) provides that where any money payable under a decree of any kind is paid out of court or where any property movable or immovable is transferred by any party to a suit to another in satisfaction of his claim under such decree, such payment or transfer shall be certified to the court whose duty it is to execute such decree. However, this rule does not apply to a compromise in Lok Adalat, as it is not a payment or transfer out of court, but a settlement in Lok Adalat. Moreover, as per Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a civil court and shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and no appeal shall lie to any court against such award. Therefore, such compromise does not require to be recorded before executing court as per Order 21 Rule 2 CPC.If reply is “yes” from Experts…then How to satisfy the Executing Court, In view of settled law of SC cited above.Since the reply is “no” from me, this question does not arise. However, if you still want to know how to satisfy the executing court in case of a compromise in Lok Adalat, you may have to produce the award or certificate issued by the Lok Adalat before the executing court and seek its execution as per Order 21 Rule 11 CPC. You may also have to show that there was no fraud or coercion involved in the compromise and that it was voluntary and lawful. However, you should consult a lawyer and follow his or her advice before taking any action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Recovery of joining bonus in case I resign before 1 year",
    "answer": "The clause in your offer letter means that if you resign from your job within one year of your date of joining, you will have to pay back the entire amount of the joining bonus to your employer. The joining bonus is a sum of money paid to you by your employer as an incentive for joining their company. It is usually subject to taxes and deductions as per the applicable laws and regulations. However, if you leave your job before completing a certain period of service, the bonus may be recovered by your employer as a penalty for breaching the contract.The term “resign” means to voluntarily quit or leave your job. It does not matter whether you serve the notice period or not, as long as you initiate the termination of your employment contract. Therefore, even if you serve more than a year in total, including the notice period, you will still be liable to pay back the joining bonus if you resign within one year of your date of joining.For example, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 3rd October 2023, you will have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned within one year of your date of joining (12th December 2022 to 11th December 2023). However, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 12th December 2023 or later, you will not have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is before 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned after completing one year of service.This is the general interpretation of the clause based on the common usage and meaning of the words. However, there may be some variations and exceptions depending on the specific terms and conditions of your employment contract, the policies and practices of your employer, and the laws and regulations governing labour and taxation in your jurisdiction. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before taking any action based on this information.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Attachment and sale of property in Restitution of Conjugal rights decree",
    "answer": "Restitution of conjugal rightsis a legal remedy that allows a spouse to compel the other spouse to cohabit or face a forfeiture of property. It is available under various personal laws in India, such as theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936.If a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsis passed by the court and the respondent does not comply with it within one year, the petitioner can file an application for attachment and sale of the respondent’s property under Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The court may order the attachment of any movable or immovable property of the respondent and direct its sale after six months of attachment. Out of the proceeds of the sale, the court may award such compensation to the petitioner as it thinks fit and pay the balance to the respondent.However, the court has to consider various factors before ordering the attachment and sale of property, such as the nature and value of the property, the income and expenses of both parties, the hardship caused to the respondent, and the possibility of reconciliation. The court also has to ensure that the attachment and sale of property is not oppressive or excessive and does not violate the fundamental rights of the respondent. The court has to balance the interests of both parties and act in accordance with justice, equity and good conscience.Therefore, in your case, it is not certain that the court will order the attachment and sale of your movable property worth 17L as compensation for non-compliance of RCR decree. It will depend on the facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider other modes of execution, such as imprisonment or community service. The amount of compensation awarded by the court may vary from case to case depending on various factors. There is no fixed formula or standard for determining the compensation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Recovery of joining bonus in case I resign before 1 year",
    "answer": "The clause in your offer letter means that if you resign from your job within one year of your date of joining, you will have to pay back the entire amount of the joining bonus to your employer. The joining bonus is a sum of money paid to you by your employer as an incentive for joining their company. It is usually subject to taxes and deductions as per the applicable laws and regulations. However, if you leave your job before completing a certain period of service, the bonus may be recovered by your employer as a penalty for breaching the contract.The term “resign” means to voluntarily quit or leave your job. It does not matter whether you serve the notice period or not, as long as you initiate the termination of your employment contract. Therefore, even if you serve more than a year in total, including the notice period, you will still be liable to pay back the joining bonus if you resign within one year of your date of joining.For example, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 3rd October 2023, you will have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned within one year of your date of joining (12th December 2022 to 11th December 2023). However, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 12th December 2023 or later, you will not have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is before 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned after completing one year of service.This is the general interpretation of the clause based on the common usage and meaning of the words. However, there may be some variations and exceptions depending on the specific terms and conditions of your employment contract, the policies and practices of your employer, and the laws and regulations governing labour and taxation in your jurisdiction. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before taking any action based on this information.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

When you resign from a job or are terminated by your employer, the notice period is the period of time between when you provide notice of your intention to leave the company and your actual departure date. During this notice period, you are usually still considered an employee, and you may be expected to continue performing your job responsibilities, unless your employer chooses to relieve you of your duties immediately and pay you in lieu of notice.So, you do not have to pay joining bonus back to your company and if they ask you to do so then that is not tenable in the eyes of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

If Vijay had obtained the power of attorney from Govind and Raj and also informed Guna about the lease agreement, then the lease agreement may be valid. However, if Vijay had acted without the consent or knowledge of Guna or you, then the lease agreement may be invalid and voidable. You can challenge the validity of the lease agreement in court on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, or breach of trust by Vijay.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can ask IOC to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. However, you may face difficulties in doing so, as IOC may claim that they are bona fide lessees who have paid rent and invested in the property in good faith. IOC may also claim that they are not aware of any dispute or defect in Vijay's title or authority to lease the land. You may have to prove that IOC had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay was not authorized to lease the land without your consent.If the agreement is not valid, can I ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump?If the agreement is not valid, you can also ask the dealer to vacate the petrol pump by sending them a legal notice or filing a suit for injunction and eviction in court. Similar to IOC, the dealer may claim to be a sub-lessee or licensee of IOC who has acted in good faith. You may need to prove that the dealer had knowledge or reason to believe that Vijay or IOC lacked the authority to lease the land without your consent.How to proceed with Vijay, who entered into a lease agreement with IOC without Guna?You can proceed against Vijay by sending him a legal notice or filing a suit for declaration and cancellation of the lease agreement in court. You can also claim damages for breach of trust and loss of income from Vijay. Seeking an injunction to restrain Vijay from interfering with your possession and enjoyment of your share of the land is an option as well.How to proceed further without going to court, like sending a letter of my own to IOC, the dealer, and Vijay?You can attempt to resolve the matter amicably by sending a letter explaining your situation and requesting them to vacate the petrol pump within a reasonable time. Offering some compensation for their investment and inconvenience might facilitate a resolution. However, if they refuse to cooperate or negotiate, you may need to seek legal assistance and pursue legal action.How to proceed further with a lawyer/court?To proceed further with a lawyer and court, you should consider hiring a lawyer experienced in property law and lease agreements. Consult with the lawyer to get advice on the best course of action. Discuss legal fees, expected timelines, and the likelihood of success for your case.

    "answer": "Based on the information provided, here are answers to your questions regarding the dispute on the legal agreement with IOC:Will this lease agreement be valid?The validity of the lease agreement depends on whether Vijay had the authority and consent of all the co-owners of the land to enter into such an agreement with IOC.

    "question": "Recovery of joining bonus in case I resign before 1 year",
    "answer": "The clause in your offer letter means that if you resign from your job within one year of your date of joining, you will have to pay back the entire amount of the joining bonus to your employer. The joining bonus is a sum of money paid to you by your employer as an incentive for joining their company. It is usually subject to taxes and deductions as per the applicable laws and regulations. However, if you leave your job before completing a certain period of service, the bonus may be recovered by your employer as a penalty for breaching the contract.The term “resign” means to voluntarily quit or leave your job. It does not matter whether you serve the notice period or not, as long as you initiate the termination of your employment contract. Therefore, even if you serve more than a year in total, including the notice period, you will still be liable to pay back the joining bonus if you resign within one year of your date of joining.For example, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 3rd October 2023, you will have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned within one year of your date of joining (12th December 2022 to 11th December 2023). However, if you joined on 12th December 2022 and resigned on 12th December 2023 or later, you will not have to pay back the joining bonus, even if your last working day is before 1st January 2024. This is because you resigned after completing one year of service.This is the general interpretation of the clause based on the common usage and meaning of the words. However, there may be some variations and exceptions depending on the specific terms and conditions of your employment contract, the policies and practices of your employer, and the laws and regulations governing labour and taxation in your jurisdiction. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before taking any action based on this information.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

It is an offence for employers to disallow employees to leave their job.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee’s decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice, and except recovery of the said amount, company cannot harm you for the same.Further , you both are under obligation to comply the terms of the offer letter , and hence if there is notice period is mentioned 90 days then no other provision will come at the time of accepting the resignation.- Further, section 27 of the Indian Contract Act prohibits any agreement in restraint of trade and profession.- You are only bound for the 90 days notice  period , and if you have already worked for the same , then the company cannot ask you to pay the bonus on any ground.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "A notice period is typically considered a part of your employment. When you resign from a job or are terminated by your employer, the notice period is the period of time between when you provide notice of your intention to leave the company and your actual departure date. During this notice period, you are usually still considered an employee, and you may be expected to continue performing your job responsibilities, unless your employer chooses to relieve you of your duties immediately and pay you in lieu of notice.So, you do not have to pay joining bonus back to your company and if they ask you to do so then that is not tenable in the eyes of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Pay Protection",
    "answer": "Pay protection is a benefit given to candidates who join Central Government posts on direct recruitment basis from other sectors such as PSUs, State Governments, etc. Pay protection means that their initial pay in the Central Government post is fixed at a stage that protects their pay and allowances drawn in their previous sector. However, there are certain conditions and criteria for availing this benefit, such as:The candidate must have completed the probation period successfully in the previous sector and obtained a regular or confirmed status.The candidate must have applied for pay protection within one month from the date of joining the Central Government post.The candidate must have submitted the necessary documents such as NOC, pay certificate, service certificate, etc. from the previous sector.The candidate must have fulfilled the minimum experience requirement prescribed in the recruitment rules for the Central Government post.The candidate must have joined the Central Government post through a proper selection process such as interview or competitive exam or both.In your case, it seems that you have applied for pay protection in CPSU after joining from a State PSU in an experienced post. However, your application was rejected by your present company on the basis of lower CTC in your previous company and the rule of their major stake holder CPSU company. You have also submitted various documents and representations to review your application, but your present company has not responded positively. You have also found out that your present company has provided pay protection to other employees who joined from various CPSU and Central Govt Sector with lower CTC than yours. You have also discovered that your present company has framed a new rule for pay protection that segregates the industries in two categories, one for all CPSU and another for Central Govt/State Govt/State PSU etc. You have also received an RTI reply from your present company that provides this rule reference to whom they provided pay protection 10 years before.Based on these facts, you may have a valid ground to file petitions in court/outside platform for pay protection.

    "question": "Pay Protection",
    "answer": "Pay protection is a benefit given to candidates who join Central Government posts on direct recruitment basis from other sectors such as PSUs, State Governments, etc. Pay protection means that their initial pay in the Central Government post is fixed at a stage that protects their pay and allowances drawn in their previous sector. However, there are certain conditions and criteria for availing this benefit, such as:The candidate must have completed the probation period successfully in the previous sector and obtained a regular or confirmed status.The candidate must have applied for pay protection within one month from the date of joining the Central Government post.The candidate must have submitted the necessary documents such as NOC, pay certificate, service certificate, etc. from the previous sector.The candidate must have fulfilled the minimum experience requirement prescribed in the recruitment rules for the Central Government post.The candidate must have joined the Central Government post through a proper selection process such as interview or competitive exam or both.In your case, it seems that you have applied for pay protection in CPSU after joining from a State PSU in an experienced post. However, your application was rejected by your present company on the basis of lower CTC in your previous company and the rule of their major stake holder CPSU company. You have also submitted various documents and representations to review your application, but your present company has not responded positively. You have also found out that your present company has provided pay protection to other employees who joined from various CPSU and Central Govt Sector with lower CTC than yours. You have also discovered that your present company has framed a new rule for pay protection that segregates the industries in two categories, one for all CPSU and another for Central Govt/State Govt/State PSU etc. You have also received an RTI reply from your present company that provides this rule reference to whom they provided pay protection 10 years before.Based on these facts, you may have a valid ground to file petitions in court/outside platform for pay protection. You can take the following steps to do so:Collect evidence: You should collect all the relevant evidence to support your claim for pay protection, such as:Your appointment letter and joining report in CPSUYour NOC and pay certificate from State PSUYour service certificate and experience certificate from State PSUYour pay slips and CTC details from State PSU and CPSUYour application and representations for pay protection in CPSUThe rejection letter and RTI reply from CPSUThe recruitment rules and eligibility criteria for your post in CPSUThe pay protection rules and guidelines issued by DPE or DOPT or any other authorityThe details of other employees who got pay protection in CPSU with lower CTC than yoursChoose a forum: You should choose a suitable forum to file your petitions, depending on the nature and value of your claim.

    "question": "GPA holder vs actual owner",
    "answer": "AGeneral Power of Attorney (GPA)is a document through which one person (Principal) appoints another person (GPA Holder) to do all acts specified therein, for and on behalf of the Principal. A GPA holder is not the owner of the property by virtue of the GPA. A GPA holder only has the authority to carry out tasks assigned by the owner, excluding selling of property. A GPA holder is not authorised to sell the property on behalf of the owner, even if the GPA is recorded with the sub-office. The Supreme Court of India has held that transactions of the nature of GPA sales do not convey any title and do not amount to transfer, nor can they be recognized or valid mode of transfer of immovable property.Therefore, if Ravikumar bought the site from Chandra, who was only a GPA holder of Sukumar Shastri, then Ravikumar did not acquire any valid title or ownership of the site. Similarly, if you bought the site from Ravikumar, then you also did not acquire any valid title or ownership of the site. The actual owner of the site would be Sukumar Shastri or his legal heirs, unless he had executed a registered sale deed in favour of N. Reddy or any other person.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "Ancestral property is a property that is inherited by a person from his or her ancestors, such as father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. In India, different personal laws govern the inheritance and succession of ancestral property among different communities. For Muslims, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the main law that regulates the inheritance and succession of ancestral property.According to Muslim law, inheritance of property takes place only after the death of a person and not by birth. The shares of the legal heirs are determined by the rules of Shariat, which are based on the Quran, Sunna, Ijma and Qiya. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim include his or her spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. The shares of each heir vary depending on their degree of relationship, gender and number.Partition of ancestral property is the process of dividing the property among the co-owners or co-sharers according to their respective shares. Partition can be done by mutual consent of the parties or by a court order. Partition can also be partial or total, depending on whether some or all of the properties are divided.To answer your follow-up question:If the majority of the members are in favour of partition except one, the court can appoint a commissioner to do the partition of the property. The commissioner will prepare a report and a preliminary decree based on the valuation and division of the property. The parties can raise their objections to the report and decree within a specified time. The court will then consider the objections and pass a final decree for partition.The valuation of the property can be decided by various methods, such as market value, income method, cost method, etc. The court can appoint a valuer or an expert to determine the value of the property based on these methods. The court can also rely on the evidence produced by the parties regarding the value of the property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day.

    "question": "Divorcing wife is asking for 50% of all my properties and more",
    "answer": "Divorce is a legal process that results in the dissolution of a marriage, either through mutual consent or by filing a petition on various grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. It often involves addressing issues such as maintenance, alimony, child custody, and property division.Property division is the distribution of assets and liabilities between the parties after a divorce. This can be done through mutual agreement or a court order, with outcomes influenced by personal laws based on religion. In India, there is no uniform law for property division, but some general rules apply:Maintenance may be claimed by either spouse after divorce, especially if one cannot support themselves or the children.Asset division is typically based on ownership title, and financial contributions may be considered.Jointly owned assets are usually equally divided or based on the proportion contributed by each party.Uncontested divorces allow for mutual agreement on asset division.In the case of Hindu law, there are statutes that regulate various aspects of marriage and divorce, including property division:TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955TheHindu Succession Act, 1956The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956Under Hindu law, there are two types of property: ancestral and self-acquired. Ancestral property is inherited from ancestors, while self-acquired property is earned or acquired independently.A wife cannot claim ownership of her husband's property, but she has rights to stridhan (property exclusively belonging to her) and the right to reside in the marital home.Stridhan includes gifts, property from her own income, savings, or inheritance.In some cases, a wife may claim a share in a husband's company if she can prove her contribution to its growth.To summarize, in your specific situation:If your house and company are self-acquired and solely financed by you, your wife cannot claim 50% ownership.Maintenance may be claimed by your wife if she cannot support herself after divorce.Stridhan may be claimed if she has property under her name.She has a right to reside in your house until she remarries or passes away.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations in your specific case and gather reevant documents and evidence to support your claims.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "Ancestral property is a property that is inherited by a person from his or her ancestors, such as father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. In India, different personal laws govern the inheritance and succession of ancestral property among different communities. For Muslims, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the main law that regulates the inheritance and succession of ancestral property.According to Muslim law, inheritance of property takes place only after the death of a person and not by birth. The shares of the legal heirs are determined by the rules of Shariat, which are based on the Quran, Sunna, Ijma and Qiya. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim include his or her spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. The shares of each heir vary depending on their degree of relationship, gender and number.Partition of ancestral property is the process of dividing the property among the co-owners or co-sharers according to their respective shares. Partition can be done by mutual consent of the parties or by a court order. Partition can also be partial or total, depending on whether some or all of the properties are divided.To answer your follow-up question:If the majority of the members are in favour of partition except one, the court can appoint a commissioner to do the partition of the property. The commissioner will prepare a report and a preliminary decree based on the valuation and division of the property. The parties can raise their objections to the report and decree within a specified time. The court will then consider the objections and pass a final decree for partition.The valuation of the property can be decided by various methods, such as market value, income method, cost method, etc. The court can appoint a valuer or an expert to determine the value of the property based on these methods. The court can also rely on the evidence produced by the parties regarding the value of the property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorcing wife is asking for 50% of all my properties and more",
    "answer": "Divorce is a legal process that results in the dissolution of a marriage, either through mutual consent or by filing a petition on various grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. It often involves addressing issues such as maintenance, alimony, child custody, and property division.Property division is the distribution of assets and liabilities between the parties after a divorce. This can be done through mutual agreement or a court order, with outcomes influenced by personal laws based on religion. In India, there is no uniform law for property division, but some general rules apply:Maintenance may be claimed by either spouse after divorce, especially if one cannot support themselves or the children.Asset division is typically based on ownership title, and financial contributions may be considered.Jointly owned assets are usually equally divided or based on the proportion contributed by each party.Uncontested divorces allow for mutual agreement on asset division.In the case of Hindu law, there are statutes that regulate various aspects of marriage and divorce, including property division:TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955TheHindu Succession Act, 1956The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956Under Hindu law, there are two types of property: ancestral and self-acquired. Ancestral property is inherited from ancestors, while self-acquired property is earned or acquired independently.A wife cannot claim ownership of her husband's property, but she has rights to stridhan (property exclusively belonging to her) and the right to reside in the marital home.Stridhan includes gifts, property from her own income, savings, or inheritance.In some cases, a wife may claim a share in a husband's company if she can prove her contribution to its growth.To summarize, in your specific situation:If your house and company are self-acquired and solely financed by you, your wife cannot claim 50% ownership.Maintenance may be claimed by your wife if she cannot support herself after divorce.Stridhan may be claimed if she has property under her name.She has a right to reside in your house until she remarries or passes away.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations in your specific case and gather reevant documents and evidence to support your claims.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "Ancestral property is a property that is inherited by a person from his or her ancestors, such as father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. In India, different personal laws govern the inheritance and succession of ancestral property among different communities. For Muslims, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the main law that regulates the inheritance and succession of ancestral property.According to Muslim law, inheritance of property takes place only after the death of a person and not by birth. The shares of the legal heirs are determined by the rules of Shariat, which are based on the Quran, Sunna, Ijma and Qiya. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim include his or her spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. The shares of each heir vary depending on their degree of relationship, gender and number.Partition of ancestral property is the process of dividing the property among the co-owners or co-sharers according to their respective shares. Partition can be done by mutual consent of the parties or by a court order. Partition can also be partial or total, depending on whether some or all of the properties are divided.To answer your follow-up question:If the majority of the members are in favour of partition except one, the court can appoint a commissioner to do the partition of the property. The commissioner will prepare a report and a preliminary decree based on the valuation and division of the property. The parties can raise their objections to the report and decree within a specified time. The court will then consider the objections and pass a final decree for partition.The valuation of the property can be decided by various methods, such as market value, income method, cost method, etc. The court can appoint a valuer or an expert to determine the value of the property based on these methods. The court can also rely on the evidence produced by the parties regarding the value of the property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit.

    "question": "Divorcing wife is asking for 50% of all my properties and more",
    "answer": "Divorce is a legal process that results in the dissolution of a marriage, either through mutual consent or by filing a petition on various grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. It often involves addressing issues such as maintenance, alimony, child custody, and property division.Property division is the distribution of assets and liabilities between the parties after a divorce. This can be done through mutual agreement or a court order, with outcomes influenced by personal laws based on religion. In India, there is no uniform law for property division, but some general rules apply:Maintenance may be claimed by either spouse after divorce, especially if one cannot support themselves or the children.Asset division is typically based on ownership title, and financial contributions may be considered.Jointly owned assets are usually equally divided or based on the proportion contributed by each party.Uncontested divorces allow for mutual agreement on asset division.In the case of Hindu law, there are statutes that regulate various aspects of marriage and divorce, including property division:TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955TheHindu Succession Act, 1956The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956Under Hindu law, there are two types of property: ancestral and self-acquired. Ancestral property is inherited from ancestors, while self-acquired property is earned or acquired independently.A wife cannot claim ownership of her husband's property, but she has rights to stridhan (property exclusively belonging to her) and the right to reside in the marital home.Stridhan includes gifts, property from her own income, savings, or inheritance.In some cases, a wife may claim a share in a husband's company if she can prove her contribution to its growth.To summarize, in your specific situation:If your house and company are self-acquired and solely financed by you, your wife cannot claim 50% ownership.Maintenance may be claimed by your wife if she cannot support herself after divorce.Stridhan may be claimed if she has property under her name.She has a right to reside in your house until she remarries or passes away.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations in your specific case and gather reevant documents and evidence to support your claims.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "Ancestral property is a property that is inherited by a person from his or her ancestors, such as father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. In India, different personal laws govern the inheritance and succession of ancestral property among different communities. For Muslims, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the main law that regulates the inheritance and succession of ancestral property.According to Muslim law, inheritance of property takes place only after the death of a person and not by birth. The shares of the legal heirs are determined by the rules of Shariat, which are based on the Quran, Sunna, Ijma and Qiya. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim include his or her spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. The shares of each heir vary depending on their degree of relationship, gender and number.Partition of ancestral property is the process of dividing the property among the co-owners or co-sharers according to their respective shares. Partition can be done by mutual consent of the parties or by a court order. Partition can also be partial or total, depending on whether some or all of the properties are divided.To answer your follow-up question:If the majority of the members are in favour of partition except one, the court can appoint a commissioner to do the partition of the property. The commissioner will prepare a report and a preliminary decree based on the valuation and division of the property. The parties can raise their objections to the report and decree within a specified time. The court will then consider the objections and pass a final decree for partition.The valuation of the property can be decided by various methods, such as market value, income method, cost method, etc. The court can appoint a valuer or an expert to determine the value of the property based on these methods. The court can also rely on the evidence produced by the parties regarding the value of the property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorcing wife is asking for 50% of all my properties and more",
    "answer": "Divorce is a legal process that results in the dissolution of a marriage, either through mutual consent or by filing a petition on various grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. It often involves addressing issues such as maintenance, alimony, child custody, and property division.Property division is the distribution of assets and liabilities between the parties after a divorce. This can be done through mutual agreement or a court order, with outcomes influenced by personal laws based on religion. In India, there is no uniform law for property division, but some general rules apply:Maintenance may be claimed by either spouse after divorce, especially if one cannot support themselves or the children.Asset division is typically based on ownership title, and financial contributions may be considered.Jointly owned assets are usually equally divided or based on the proportion contributed by each party.Uncontested divorces allow for mutual agreement on asset division.In the case of Hindu law, there are statutes that regulate various aspects of marriage and divorce, including property division:TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955TheHindu Succession Act, 1956The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956Under Hindu law, there are two types of property: ancestral and self-acquired. Ancestral property is inherited from ancestors, while self-acquired property is earned or acquired independently.A wife cannot claim ownership of her husband's property, but she has rights to stridhan (property exclusively belonging to her) and the right to reside in the marital home.Stridhan includes gifts, property from her own income, savings, or inheritance.In some cases, a wife may claim a share in a husband's company if she can prove her contribution to its growth.To summarize, in your specific situation:If your house and company are self-acquired and solely financed by you, your wife cannot claim 50% ownership.Maintenance may be claimed by your wife if she cannot support herself after divorce.Stridhan may be claimed if she has property under her name.She has a right to reside in your house until she remarries or passes away.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations in your specific case and gather reevant documents and evidence to support your claims.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "Ancestral property is a property that is inherited by a person from his or her ancestors, such as father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. In India, different personal laws govern the inheritance and succession of ancestral property among different communities. For Muslims, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the main law that regulates the inheritance and succession of ancestral property.According to Muslim law, inheritance of property takes place only after the death of a person and not by birth. The shares of the legal heirs are determined by the rules of Shariat, which are based on the Quran, Sunna, Ijma and Qiya. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim include his or her spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. The shares of each heir vary depending on their degree of relationship, gender and number.Partition of ancestral property is the process of dividing the property among the co-owners or co-sharers according to their respective shares. Partition can be done by mutual consent of the parties or by a court order. Partition can also be partial or total, depending on whether some or all of the properties are divided.To answer your follow-up question:If the majority of the members are in favour of partition except one, the court can appoint a commissioner to do the partition of the property. The commissioner will prepare a report and a preliminary decree based on the valuation and division of the property. The parties can raise their objections to the report and decree within a specified time. The court will then consider the objections and pass a final decree for partition.The valuation of the property can be decided by various methods, such as market value, income method, cost method, etc. The court can appoint a valuer or an expert to determine the value of the property based on these methods. The court can also rely on the evidence produced by the parties regarding the value of the property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights. You should book a round-trip ticket with a confirmed return date within the validity of your visa.You can stay in the home of your boyfriend after arriving in India, but you have to register yourself with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 14 days of your arrival. You have to provide your address proof, such as a utility bill or a rent agreement, and a letter of invitation from your boyfriend stating that he is hosting you and allowing you to stay in his home. You do not need to provide evidence of hotel room reservation if you are staying with your boyfriend .You have to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in India. The amount may vary depending on the duration and purpose of your visit, but generally, it should be around $50-$100 per day. You can provide your bank statement, credit card statement, or any other proof of income or savings as evidence of funds.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit.

    "question": "Divorcing wife is asking for 50% of all my properties and more",
    "answer": "Divorce is a legal process that results in the dissolution of a marriage, either through mutual consent or by filing a petition on various grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, or mental disorder. It often involves addressing issues such as maintenance, alimony, child custody, and property division.Property division is the distribution of assets and liabilities between the parties after a divorce. This can be done through mutual agreement or a court order, with outcomes influenced by personal laws based on religion. In India, there is no uniform law for property division, but some general rules apply:Maintenance may be claimed by either spouse after divorce, especially if one cannot support themselves or the children.Asset division is typically based on ownership title, and financial contributions may be considered.Jointly owned assets are usually equally divided or based on the proportion contributed by each party.Uncontested divorces allow for mutual agreement on asset division.In the case of Hindu law, there are statutes that regulate various aspects of marriage and divorce, including property division:TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955TheHindu Succession Act, 1956The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956Under Hindu law, there are two types of property: ancestral and self-acquired. Ancestral property is inherited from ancestors, while self-acquired property is earned or acquired independently.A wife cannot claim ownership of her husband's property, but she has rights to stridhan (property exclusively belonging to her) and the right to reside in the marital home.Stridhan includes gifts, property from her own income, savings, or inheritance.In some cases, a wife may claim a share in a husband's company if she can prove her contribution to its growth.To summarize, in your specific situation:If your house and company are self-acquired and solely financed by you, your wife cannot claim 50% ownership.Maintenance may be claimed by your wife if she cannot support herself after divorce.Stridhan may be claimed if she has property under her name.She has a right to reside in your house until she remarries or passes away.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations in your specific case and gather reevant documents and evidence to support your claims.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, a person has the right to make a will to dispose of their property as they see fit. If the widow wishes to make a registered will in favor of her nephew, she generally has the legal right to do so. However, there are a few important considerations:Competency: The person making the will (testator) should be of sound mind at the time of making the will. It's important to ensure that the widow is mentally capable of making decisions and understands the implications of her will.Free Will: The will must be made voluntarily and without any pressure or coercion from others. If it is found that the widow was forced or influenced to make the will against her wishes, it may be challenged in court.Registration: While it is not mandatory for a will to be registered, registering a will with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances can provide additional evidence of its authenticity and can help prevent disputes.Testamentary Capacity: It's crucial to establish that the widow had the testamentary capacity to make a will. If there are doubts about her mental capacity at the time of making the will, it can be challenged in court.Natural Heirs: If the widow's husband had brothers, they may have some claim to his property if there was no valid will. However, if a valid will exists, it can supersede their claims, and the property would pass according to the terms of the will.Legal Advice: It is advisable for the widow to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in wills and property matters to ensure that the will is drafted correctly and can withstand potential challenges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a property be transferred to a person after the demise through making a Will ?",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a widow has the right to inherit the property of her deceased husband, whether it is self-acquired or ancestral. She can make a will in favour of anyone she wishes, including her nephew, and dispose of her property as per her wish. A will is a legal document that expresses the intention of the testator (the person making the will) regarding the distribution of his or her property after death. A will can be registered or unregistered, but it must be in writing and signed by the testator and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the will.If the widow makes a valid will in favour of her nephew, then he will become the owner of the property after her death. The brothers of her husband cannot claim any right over the property, as they are not legal heirs of the widow. The widow’s legal heirs are her parents, if alive, or her siblings, if any. However, if the widow dies without making a will, then her property will be divided among her legal heirs according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956. In that case, the nephew will not get any share in the property, unless he is adopted by the widow as her son.Therefore, it is advisable for the widow to make a registered will in favour of her nephew and keep it in a safe place. She can also inform her nephew and other relatives about her will and its contents. This will prevent any disputes or challenges to the will after her death.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "You can apply for a tourist visa to meet and marry your boyfriend in India, but you cannot convert it to an X-visa (entry visa) while staying in India. You have to leave India and apply for an X-visa from your country or any other country where you are legally residing. The X-visa is granted to the spouse or children of an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin.The e-tourist visa is a short-term visa that is valid for 30 days from the date of arrival in India. It is issued online and allows double entry. It cannot be extended or converted into any other type of visa. The regular paper tourist visa is a long-term visa that can be valid for up to 10 years, depending on your nationality and the discretion of the Indian consulate. It allows multiple entries and can be extended in India under exceptional circumstances. However, it cannot be converted into an X-visa either.Based on this information, it seems that you can apply for either the e-tourist visa or the regular paper tourist visa to visit India and marry your boyfriend, but you have to return to your country or any other country and apply for an X-visa to stay with him in India. You should specify the purpose of your visa as tourism or visiting friends and relatives, and not as marriage, as marriage is not a valid purpose for a tourist visa. You should also choose the duration of your visa according to your travel plans and availability of flights.

    "question": "Tourist visa and marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,it's essential to check with the official Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine for the most up-to-date and specific requirements for your visa application, as rules and regulations may change over time. Here are some answers to your questions:Type of Tourist Visa: If you plan to eventually convert your tourist visa to an X-visa for marriage, it's advisable to apply for a regular paper tourist visa rather than an e-tourist visa. The e-tourist visa may have limitations on conversion.Purpose of Visa Application: In your visa application, specify the purpose as \"Tourism and Marriage.\"Duration of Tourist Visa: To allow sufficient time for marriage registration and the conversion process, you may want to apply for a tourist visa with a longer duration, such as 6 months. The time interval between your outbound and return ticket should correspond to your intended stay. It's important to be honest about your intended duration of stay.Accommodation: While the requirements may state that you need proof of hotel reservations, it's possible to stay with your boyfriend. In such a case, having an invitation letter from your boyfriend stating that you will be staying with him can be helpful. It's best to contact the Indian Embassy to clarify the specific requirements for this invitation, whether it needs to be apostilled, and whether an electronic version is acceptable.Financial Requirements: The required amount of funds can vary, but it's generally expected that you have enough money to cover your stay, including accommodation, food, and other expenses. The specific amount may depend on your intended duration of stay and the cost of living in the region of India you plan to visit. It's best to have a reasonable amount in your bank account to demonstrate financial sufficiency.Remember that visa requirements can change, and it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by the Indian Embassy or Consulate in Ukraine when applying for your visa."

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer.

This can be useful if you are unable to make decisions for yourself, or if you need someone to help manage your finances, property, or other important affairsBesides the GPA, you may need other documents like property titles, clearances, and any relevant tax records.Regarding the Will document and Generic GPA, you may have the right to request them, but their disclosure would depend on the willingness of Son2 and Son1 to share these documents.

    "question": "Typing error in rectification deed",
    "answer": "A rectification deed is a legal instrument that allows you to correct any minor errors or mistakes in your property documents, such as spelling errors, typing errors, mistakes in property description, etc. A rectification deed is also known as a correction deed, confirmation deed, supplementary deed, amendment deed, etc. A rectification deed is recognized under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and has to be registered to become legally valid.In your case, you have found some typing errors in the rectification deed that was done to correct the measurement of the property in the gift deed. The errors are related to the date and the unit of measurement. These errors can be rectified by executing another rectification deed with the consent of all the parties involved in the original deed. The second rectification deed should clearly mention the errors and the corrections made in the first rectification deed and refer to the registration number and date of the first rectification deed. The second rectification deed should also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable.Alternatively, you can also cancel the first rectification deed and execute a fresh rectification deed with the correct details. However, this may involve more time and cost, as you may have to pay the stamp duty and registration fees again for cancelling and registering the new rectification deed.A deed of declaration is another option that you can consider. A deed of declaration is a document that declares or clarifies certain facts or circumstances related to a property or a transaction. A deed of declaration can be used to explain or supplement the information given in another document, such as a sale deed or a gift deed. A deed of declaration can also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable .The procedure to correct the typing error in your rectification deed may depend on your preference and convenience.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Mental harassment by my wife",
    "answer": "You may be a victim of mental harassment and cruelty by your wife. Mental harassment and cruelty is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Mental harassment and cruelty can be defined as any conduct or behaviour that causes mental pain, agony, or suffering to the other spouse and makes it impossible for them to live together peacefully.Some of the examples of mental harassment and cruelty by a wife are:Constantly abusing, insulting, or humiliating the husband or his family members verbally or physically.Threatening to file false cases ofdomestic violence, dowry, or adultery against the husband or his family members.Refusing to perform marital duties or have sexual relations with the husband without any valid reason.Denying the husband access or contact with his child or children without any valid reason.Demanding excessive money or gifts from the husband or his family members.If you are facing any of these situations, you can take legal action against your wife for mental harassment and cruelty. Some of the legal remedies available for you are:You can file a complaint with the police or the magistrate against your wife for cruelty underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). This section covers the cases where there is the infliction of physical or mental harassment on a married man by his wife or her relatives. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offences are also non-bailable and non-compoundable.You can file a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 27(1)(d) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. You have to prove that your wife has treated you with such cruelty that it is not possible for you to live with her. You have to provide evidence of her cruel behaviour, such as audio recordings, video recordings, chat screenshots, witness statements, medical reports, etc. You can also claim alimony, custody, or maintenance from your wife depending on your circumstances.You can file a petition for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty under Section 10(1)(b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or Section 23(1)(a) of theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 in the family court. Judicial separation is a legal process where the spouses live separately without dissolving their marriage. It may be a temporary or permanent arrangement depending on their mutual consent. Judicial separation may help you to resolve your differences with your wife or prepare for divorce if reconciliation is not possible.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for your future course of action. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with your wife amicably through counselling, mediation, or negotiation. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Marrying an American",
    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Whatsapp and Email",
    "answer": "You can pass on your instructions for your divorce case through Whatsapp messages or email, as long as you and your lawyer agree on the terms and conditions of such communication. Whatsapp messages and email are considered as valid evidence in Indian courts, as they fall under the category of electronic records under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, you should also be aware of the risks and challenges of using such modes of communication, such as:The authenticity and integrity of the messages or email may be questioned or challenged by the other party or the court, as they can be easily manipulated, deleted, hacked or forged.The confidentiality and privacy of the messages or email may be compromised or violated by third parties, such as service providers, hackers, spyware, etc.The admissibility and reliability of the messages or email may depend on various factors, such as the source, destination, date, time, signature, encryption, etc., of the communication. You may also need to produce additional evidence or witnesses to corroborate or support your messages or email.Therefore, you should follow some best practices and precautions while communicating with your lawyer through Whatsapp messages or email, such as:You should have a written agreement or contract with your lawyer that specifies the scope, purpose, frequency and mode of communication between you and your lawyer. The agreement should also mention the fees, expenses, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in relation to the communication.You should use a secure and reliable platform or service for sending and receiving messages or email. You should also use strong passwords, encryption, antivirus software and other security measures to protect your devices and accounts from unauthorized access or interference.You should keep a backup or copy of all your messages or email in a safe place. You should also maintain a record of the date, time, sender, receiver and subject of each message or email. You should also avoid deleting or altering any message or email that may be relevant for your case.You should use clear and concise language and avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding in your messages or email. You should also avoid using any abusive, offensive or defamatory language that may harm your reputation or case. You should also respect the professional ethics and etiquette of your lawyer and avoid any unnecessary or excessive communication.The best mode of communication for your situation may depend on your personal preference and convenience. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Whatsapp messages or email are:Whatsapp messages are faster and easier to send and receive than email. They are also more interactive and informal than email. However, Whatsapp messages may not have a legal validity or recognition in some countries or jurisdictions. They may also have a lower quality or resolution than email. They may also be subject to data charges or network issues.Email is more formal and professional than Whatsapp messages. They are also more widely accepted and recognized as legal evidence in most countries or jurisdictions. They can also have a higher quality or resolution than Whatsapp messages. They can also attach documents, images, videos or other files that may be relevant for your case. However, email may be slower and harder to send and receive than Whatsapp messages. They may also be less interactive and more impersonal than Whatsapp messages. They may also be subject to spam filters or storage limits.You can avoid conflicts with your lawyer by communicating with him/her in a respectful, honest and cooperative manner. You should also follow his/her advice and instructions regarding your case. You should also pay his/her fees and expenses on time and in full. You should also inform him/her about any changes or developments in your situation that may affect your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Power of Attorney Rights in Divorce Case",
    "answer": "A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that authorizes a person (the agent or attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of another person (the principal or donor) in certain matters. A POA can be general or specific, depending on the scope and extent of the authority granted by the principal to the agent.In case of divorce proceedings, a POA can be used by a principal who resides outside India and cannot be present for the execution of the divorce. The principal can appoint an agent by way of a notarized POA with apostille certification to represent him or her in the court. The agent can file the divorce petition, submit the documents, appear for the hearings, and receive the decree on behalf of the principal.However, a POA cannot do everything that the principal can do in a divorce case. Some of the limitations of a POA are:A POA cannot file a divorce petition on behalf of the principal without his or her consent and signature. The principal has to sign the divorce petition and verify it through the agent.A POA cannot give evidence or testify on behalf of the principal in the court. The principal has to give his or her own evidence through video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction.A POA cannot compromise or settle the divorce case without the express consent and instruction of the principal. The principal has to approve any agreement or arrangement made by the agent with the other party.A POA cannot act against the interest or will of the principal in any manner. The agent has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and loyalty towards the principal.To make sure that the POA acts in your best interest while you are away, you should choose a trustworthy and reliable person as your agent, such as a close friend, relative, or lawyer. You should also communicate with your agent regularly and monitor his or her actions and progress in your case. You should also review and sign all the documents and papers related to your case before they are submitted to the court. You should also be ready to appear for video conferencing or other means as per the court’s direction whenever required.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Changing lawyer",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The requirements for canceling services with a lawyer can vary based on your location and the terms outlined in the agreement you have with the lawyer. In many cases, a simple written notice may suffice, but it's often better to follow the specific guidelines outlined in your contract or engagement agreement with the lawyer. Sometimes, contracts stipulate the method or form of cancellation, which might include sending a formal letter or notice. Others might accept an email or a written statement. However, it's crucial to ensure that whatever method you choose meets the legal requirements and the terms of the agreement. If you're unsure about the appropriate method or if your agreement doesn't specify, it's a good idea to reach out to the lawyer or their firm directly to confirm the correct procedure for canceling services. This can prevent any misunderstandings or potential issues down the line.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval. The possibility of getting back wages and employment upon company revival hinges on feasibility, viability, and worker consent. The IBC prevails over the IDA in matters of corporate insolvency.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Developer suppressed the ongoing litigation while selling under construction flat",
    "answer": "You may have a case of fraud and misrepresentation against the developer for suppressing the pending litigation while selling the under construction flat. Fraud and misrepresentation are grounds for cancellation of contract and claiming damages under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Fraud is defined as any act or omission that is intended to deceive or induce another person to enter into a contract. Misrepresentation is defined as any statement or assertion that is untrue or misleading, but not made with an intention to deceive.Some of the elements of fraud and misrepresentation are:There must be a false or misleading statement or omission of a material fact by one party to another party.The statement or omission must relate to an essential or important aspect of the contract, such as the title, possession, quality, or value of the property.The statement or omission must induce or influence the other party to enter into the contract or act upon it.The other party must suffer some loss or injury as a result of relying on the statement or omission.In your case, you may be able to prove these elements by showing that:The developer did not inform you or disclose to you about the two pending litigation related to the project at the time of agreement and registration.The litigation was a material fact that affected the legal status and value of the property and your rights and interests as a buyer.You entered into the contract and paid 85% of the total payment based on the developer’s representation that the property was free from any legal disputes or encumbrances.You suffered loss and injury as you could not take possession of the property, faced legal action from the plaintiff, and had to stop further payment due to the litigation.Therefore, you may have a valid ground to cancel the contract and claim damages from the developer for fraud and misrepresentation.Some of the legal options available for you are:You can file a civil suit against the developer in the competent court in India for cancellation of contract, specific performance, injunction, declaration, or compensation. You can also seek interim relief from the court to restrain the developer from selling or transferring the property to any other person or creating any third party rights over it.You can file a criminal complaint against the developer in the police station or the magistrate’s court in India for cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, or criminal conspiracy under theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These offences are punishable with imprisonment and fine.You can file a consumer complaint against the developer in the consumer forum or commission in India for deficiency in service, unfair trade practice, or violation of consumer rights under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. You can claim refund, compensation, interest, or penalty from the developer.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for taking legal action against the developer for putting you in such a situation. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with the developer amicably through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer.

    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is a law that allows people of different religions, nationalities, or castes to get married in India. It is a civil contract that does not require any religious rites or ceremonies. It also provides for the registration and recognition of the marriage under the Indian law.To get married under theSpecial Marriage Act, you and your boyfriend have to follow these steps:You have to apply in writing to the marriage registrar of the district where either of you has resided for at least 30 days before the date of marriage. You have to fill a form and submit it along with some documents, such as proof of age, identity, address, marital status, etc.The marriage registrar will then publish a notice of your intended marriage in his office and in a newspaper for 30 days. The notice will invite any objections from the public to your marriage.If no objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will solemnize your marriage in his office in the presence of three witnesses. You and your boyfriend will have to sign a declaration and a marriage certificate.If any objections are received within 30 days, the marriage registrar will conduct an inquiry and decide whether to allow or reject your marriage. If he rejects your marriage, you can appeal to the district court within 30 days.The marriage certificate issued by the marriage registrar is a valid proof of your marriage and can be used for various purposes, such as applying for a visa, passport, bank account, etc.If your family raises any objection to your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, you can do the following things:You can try to convince them that your marriage is based on love and mutual respect and that it does not affect your religion or culture. You can also seek the help of some relatives or friends who support your decision and can mediate with your family.You can ignore their objection and proceed with your marriage if you are sure that they cannot prove any valid ground for objection, such as fraud, coercion, impotency, insanity, etc. You can also seek legal protection from the police or the court if they threaten or harass you or your boyfriend.You can opt for another way of getting married, such as under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. However, these laws may require you or your boyfriend to convert to Hinduism or Christianity respectively and follow certain religious rites or ceremonies. These laws may also have different conditions and consequences for your marriage.Your boyfriend does not need to stay in India for marriage registration if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. He can leave India after signing the declaration and the marriage certificate in the presence of three witnesses. However, he may need to stay in India for some time if you get married under any other law that requires his personal appearance before a priest or a magistrate.Your marriage will not affect your residential status in India if you get married under theSpecial Marriage Act. You will remain an Indian citizen and enjoy all the rights and duties as such. However, if you want to move to the US with your husband, you will need to apply for a spouse visa from the US embassy or consulate in India. You will also need to submit some documents, such as your marriage certificate, passport, birth certificate, medical report, etc.As a married couple under theSpecial Marriage Act, you will get some rights and benefits, such as:The right to inherit each other’s property and assets in case of death or divorce.The right to claim maintenance or alimony from each other in case of separation or divorce.The right to adopt children or be guardians of each other’s children.The right to file joint tax returns and claim deductions or exemptions.The right to visit each other in hospitals or prisons.The right to make medical or financial decisions for each other in case of incapacity.However, you will also have some obligations and responsibilities towards each other, such as:The duty to live together and cohabit as husband and wife.The duty to be faithful and loyal to each other and not commit adultery.The duty to support and maintain each other according to their means and needs.The duty to respect and protect each other’s dignity and rights.The duty to share household chores and expenses.The duty to care for and educate their children.”Now, based on the question and its long answer, I request you to make a summary of the answer, by addressing all the questions and concerns expressed by the questionerMuraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, it is advisable to appoint an impartial person as an executor who can carry out the wishes of the testator without any conflict of interest or bias.An executor can charge a fee for his services, but only if the will expressly authorizes him to do so. Otherwise, he cannot claim any remuneration or compensation for his work as an executor. The fee charged by the executor should be reasonable and proportionate to the work done by him.The fee received by the executor is taxable in his hands as income from other sources under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The executor has to declare the fee as part of his income and pay tax on it according to his applicable slab rate.

In many cases, a simple written notice may suffice, but it's often better to follow the specific guidelines outlined in your contract or engagement agreement with the lawyer. Sometimes, contracts stipulate the method or form of cancellation, which might include sending a formal letter or notice. Others might accept an email or a written statement. However, it's crucial to ensure that whatever method you choose meets the legal requirements and the terms of the agreement. If you're unsure about the appropriate method or if your agreement doesn't specify, it's a good idea to reach out to the lawyer or their firm directly to confirm the correct procedure for canceling services.

    "question": "Registered generic GPA without specific properties details",
    "answer": "To execute the sale deed in your favor, the mother (as the seller) and you (as the buyer) are the necessary parties. The mother should sign the sale deed and transfer the title of the property to you. You should pay the agreed sale consideration and register the sale deed with the sub-registrar’s office. You may also need two witnesses to attest the sale deed.The generic GPA given by Son2 to Son1 is legally acceptable, but it may not be relevant or useful in this transaction. This is because the GPA only authorizes Son1 to act on behalf of Son2 for his properties, but not for his mother’s properties. Since Son2 has already gifted the property to his mother in 2018, he has no right or interest in that property anymore. Therefore, Son1 cannot use the GPA to sell or buy that property on behalf of Son2.There are some other documents that you can request Son2 to assist in your sale deed process, such as:A copy of the gift deed executed by Son2 in favor of his mother in 2018, to verify that the property was legally transferred to her and that she is the absolute owner of the property.A copy of the registered will executed by Son2 in favor of his mother, to confirm that he has no claim or objection to the sale of the property by his mother.A no-objection certificate (NOC) from Son2, stating that he has no objection to the sale of the property by his mother and that he will not challenge or dispute the sale deed in future.You have the right to ask for the will document and the generic GPA document from Son2 or his mother, as they are relevant for your transaction and may affect your rights and interests as a buyer. You can also verify these documents from the concerned authorities or offices where they are registered or recorded.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This can be useful if you are unable to make decisions for yourself, or if you need someone to help manage your finances, property, or other important affairsBesides the GPA, you may need other documents like property titles, clearances, and any relevant tax records.Regarding the Will document and Generic GPA, you may have the right to request them, but their disclosure would depend on the willingness of Son2 and Son1 to share these documents.

    "question": "Claim of wages for the period of lockout",
    "answer": "The claim of workers for wages and benefits during the lockout period depends on various factors:The legality of the lockout: If the lockout was legal, workers may not be entitled to wages for that period, based on the principle of \"no work, no pay.\" If it was illegal, they may be entitled to full wages.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If the company goes into insolvency under the IBC, the situation becomes complex. Workers' claims are considered operational and rank lower than secured financial creditors. They may not receive full dues or have much say in the resolution plan.Moratorium: Legal actions, including cases before the Industrial Court, may be stayed or suspended during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the IBC.Resolution Applicant: The resolution applicant may acquire the corporate debtor's rights and assets but may not be liable for all debts and liabilities.Company Revival: If the resolution applicant sells the company to another for revival, workers' rights and interests may be unaffected unless they agree or it's necessary for revival or liquidation.IBC vs. IDA: The IBC prevails over the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in matters related to insolvency and bankruptcy of corporate entities.In conclusion, the outcome of workers' claims depends on the specifics of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC. They may or may not receive wages, closure compensation, gratuity, provident fund, leave encashment, and bonus, depending on the resolution plan and NCLT's approval. The possibility of getting back wages and employment upon company revival hinges on feasibility, viability, and worker consent.

    "question": "Typing error in rectification deed",
    "answer": "A rectification deed is a legal instrument that allows you to correct any minor errors or mistakes in your property documents, such as spelling errors, typing errors, mistakes in property description, etc. A rectification deed is also known as a correction deed, confirmation deed, supplementary deed, amendment deed, etc. A rectification deed is recognized under Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 and has to be registered to become legally valid.In your case, you have found some typing errors in the rectification deed that was done to correct the measurement of the property in the gift deed. The errors are related to the date and the unit of measurement. These errors can be rectified by executing another rectification deed with the consent of all the parties involved in the original deed. The second rectification deed should clearly mention the errors and the corrections made in the first rectification deed and refer to the registration number and date of the first rectification deed. The second rectification deed should also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable.Alternatively, you can also cancel the first rectification deed and execute a fresh rectification deed with the correct details. However, this may involve more time and cost, as you may have to pay the stamp duty and registration fees again for cancelling and registering the new rectification deed.A deed of declaration is another option that you can consider. A deed of declaration is a document that declares or clarifies certain facts or circumstances related to a property or a transaction. A deed of declaration can be used to explain or supplement the information given in another document, such as a sale deed or a gift deed. A deed of declaration can also be registered with the sub-registrar’s office and pay the stamp duty and registration fees as applicable .The procedure to correct the typing error in your rectification deed may depend on your preference and convenience.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Developer suppressed the ongoing litigation while selling under construction flat",
    "answer": "You may have a case of fraud and misrepresentation against the developer for suppressing the pending litigation while selling the under construction flat. Fraud and misrepresentation are grounds for cancellation of contract and claiming damages under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Fraud is defined as any act or omission that is intended to deceive or induce another person to enter into a contract. Misrepresentation is defined as any statement or assertion that is untrue or misleading, but not made with an intention to deceive.Some of the elements of fraud and misrepresentation are:There must be a false or misleading statement or omission of a material fact by one party to another party.The statement or omission must relate to an essential or important aspect of the contract, such as the title, possession, quality, or value of the property.The statement or omission must induce or influence the other party to enter into the contract or act upon it.The other party must suffer some loss or injury as a result of relying on the statement or omission.In your case, you may be able to prove these elements by showing that:The developer did not inform you or disclose to you about the two pending litigation related to the project at the time of agreement and registration.The litigation was a material fact that affected the legal status and value of the property and your rights and interests as a buyer.You entered into the contract and paid 85% of the total payment based on the developer’s representation that the property was free from any legal disputes or encumbrances.You suffered loss and injury as you could not take possession of the property, faced legal action from the plaintiff, and had to stop further payment due to the litigation.Therefore, you may have a valid ground to cancel the contract and claim damages from the developer for fraud and misrepresentation.Some of the legal options available for you are:You can file a civil suit against the developer in the competent court in India for cancellation of contract, specific performance, injunction, declaration, or compensation. You can also seek interim relief from the court to restrain the developer from selling or transferring the property to any other person or creating any third party rights over it.You can file a criminal complaint against the developer in the police station or the magistrate’s court in India for cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, or criminal conspiracy under theIndian Penal Code, 1860. These offences are punishable with imprisonment and fine.You can file a consumer complaint against the developer in the consumer forum or commission in India for deficiency in service, unfair trade practice, or violation of consumer rights under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. You can claim refund, compensation, interest, or penalty from the developer.These are some of the legal options that you can consider for taking legal action against the developer for putting you in such a situation. However, before taking any legal step, you should also try to resolve your issues with the developer amicably through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. You should also consult a lawyer or a legal expert for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"
