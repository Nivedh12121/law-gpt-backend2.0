    "question": "How to file a suit for divorce decree and procedures",
    "answer": "Dear Client,After the completion of the talaq procedure, you need to file a suit in the Family Court for a divorce decree. Since you are an NRI, your advocate can file the suit on your behalf with a power of attorney. Your wife may contest the divorce in court but if the court is satisfied that the talaq was pronounced in compliance with the law, it will grant a divorce decree. Given your situation and the threats you are receiving, it is advisable to handle the legal proceedings through your advocate to avoid any confrontations or adverse consequences. Even if you have been separated for more than 10 years, your wife may be eligible for maintenance under Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC), provided she is unable to maintain herself. You sending monthly expenses, shows that you have been providing financial support. This may impact the court’s decision on maintenance and since your children are majors, they are not entitled to maintenance unless they are unable to support themselves due to physical or mental infirmity. As a Muslim man, you are permitted to have up to four wives at the same time, provided you can treat them equally. Therefore, your second marriage is not considered bigamy under Muslim personal law. Hence, it is advisable to Engage a competent lawyer to represent you in court. Ensure you provide a power of attorney so they can act on your behalf. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of parking space",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When purchasing a flat that includes an open parking space, it is important to ensure that the parking allotment is properly transferred to your name. Here are the steps and considerations:First, verify that the seller has legal rights to the parking space through the allotment letter from the builder. This letter should explicitly mention the parking space number and its allocation to the seller.Next, include the details of the open parking space in the sale agreement. This ensures that the parking space is legally recognized as part of the property you are purchasing.Although open parking spaces are not typically registered separately, you should obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the builder or the housing society, confirming the transfer of the parking space to your name.Regarding the valuation of the property, the details of the open parking space should be included in the overall valuation. While open parking may not significantly increase the property’s value, it is a valuable amenity that can affect the total worth and appeal of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "With the death of the proprietor legally the business also ends with him, however the GST law provides a facility whereby the legal heirs can continue the business if they desire so and has provided with a detailed instructions on how such transfer shall take place. In the event of death of the proprietor its legal heirs have an option of either continuing the business or discontinuing.2)If option exercised by the legal heirs is that they will continue the business of the deceased then the following will be applicable: As per Section 29 the registration of the deceased is still liable to be cancelled. Steps to be taken by the Legal Heirs: – 1. Apply for fresh registration citing reason as Death of Proprietor and Date on which liability arises as Date of death of deceased.3)2. Section 29 allows legal heirs to file application for cancellation. Therefore, legal heirs will have to get themselves registered as Authorised Signatories in GSTIN of the deceased. 3. To be added as Authorised Signatories Amendment in Registration will not be done by the legal heirs themselves but will have to approach the jurisdictional officer. (Section 28 read with Rule 19 allows only registered person to apply for amendment registration)4. Legal Heirs will have to prove that they are the legal heirs of the deceased (Legal Heirs are defined in the personnel laws as enforced on the date).5. Transfer the business 6. Transfer ITC in the credit ledger of the deceased to the new registration by filing ITC-02 7. Apply for cancellation of the registration of deceased within 30 days and file GSTR10.In CIT v. Madhukant M. Mehta (supra) the case of the assessee was that on the death of sole proprietor the legal heirs forming partnership firm and issue was whether the firm succeeded in the business of sole proprietor, assessee is entitled to carry forward loss of sole proprietor and to set off against the income of the firm. The Gujarat High Court has taken the view as under :\"(i) that the presence of the three factors found by the Income Tax Officer was not necessarily destructive of the integrity or identity of the business so as to negative the idea of succession; (ii) that the facts showed that M had died intestate. Under section 8 of theHindu Succession Acthis property would devolve, firstly, upon the heirs being relatives specified in Class I of the Schedule. Son, daughter and widow are included in Class I. There was a clear recital in the partnership deed that the partners as heirs succeeded to the business of the deceased. The business of the deceased had been carried on even prior to the execution of the partnership deed and the partnership was brought into existence within a very short period after M's death. Having regard to all the circumstances there was succession by inheritance in this case. Merely because M's legal heirs brought into existence a firm and decided to carry on the same business under the firm name, the succession by inheritance was not lost or destroyed. The link or nexus between the business carried on by the deceased and after his death by his heirs previously as a body of heirs and subsequently as a collection of persons joined with each other by the bond of partnership was not lost either in substance or in form and the business, which the firm carried on, still remained the same business which was succeeded to by inheritance by the heirs who were partners. The assessee-firm was entitled to carry forward and set off the speculation losses of M against the income from speculation business earned during the relevant assessment years.\"The view taken by the Gujarat High Court in (1981) 132 ITR 159 (Guj) (supra) has been upheld by the Supreme Court in case of CIT v.

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "If a sole proprietor dies, their legal heirs or representatives need to manage the business and handle the legal procedures, such as cancelling the GST registration or transferring the business to their name.In the case of the death of a proprietor, the accounting treatment involves the valuation and recording of assets and liabilities, preparation of final accounts, and distribution of profits/losses among the legal heirs or representatives.In case of the death of a sole proprietor, the business can either be cancelled or transferred to the legal heirs or a new owner. Transfer of business in case of death of a sole proprietor includes obtaining legal certificates, transferring assets and liabilities, and applying for the transfer of ITC.This is because the legal heir will need to apply for a new GST registration in their own name and cannot continue the business in the name of the deceased sole proprietor due to the proprietor having a different PAN.As per Section 29 of the CGST Act, the GST registration will need to be cancelled on the death of a sole proprietor, and the business can be transferred thereafter.They need to apply for the transfer of Input Tax Credit (ITC) by filing Form GST ITC-02 on the GST common portal.As per Section 22 of the CGST Act, they need to apply for a fresh GST registration in Form GST REG-01 using their own PAN as they cannot use the existing registration of the deceased proprietor.Section 18(3) of the CGST Act, 2017 allows the transfer of ITC where the business is being transferred as long as the business’s liabilities are also being transferred in the manner specified in Rule 41.Further, section 93(1) states that if the person liable to pay tax, interest or penalty passes away, the individual who continues the deceased person’s business shall be liable to pay those tax dues.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "- A sole proprietor is a person who is a sole owner of a business and who runs that business by itself, and in case of a sole proprietorship dies then his business will immediately come to an end.- Further, as per  the Indian Succession act, after the death of the sole Proprietor, his/her legal heirs do not automatically start to inherit the old business of the deceased, but they only get to inherit the assets.- Further, the legal heirs of the deceased have the option of winding up the business after filling GST and Tax under section 29(1) and section 93(1)(b) of CGST Act, 2017.1. The bank is under obligation to transfer the entire amount to the legal heirs either by way of Nominee claim procedure or after getting required winding up documents .2. In case of transfer of business on account of death of sole proprietor, the successor shall file FORM GST ITC-02 in respect of the registration which is required to be cancelled on account of death of the sole proprietor.- Hence, you can apply for fresh registration citing reason as Death of sole Proprietor and then after the said registration you will have right to transfer the property /fund in the partnership firm.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Following your father's sudden demise, you face two primary challenges with his firms: the sole proprietorship and the partnership firm. For the sole proprietorship, bank accounts cannot be operated, and you must follow the nominee claim procedure, which results in account closure. However, FDRs maturing in the future and the need for debit facilities complicate matters. You may need to consult with the bank for a possible solution to keep the account active until all financial obligations are settled.For the partnership firm, transferring assets and liabilities from the sole proprietorship to the partnership firm can help. This transfer allows the partnership firm to utilize the work experience and bid capacity of the sole proprietorship for tenders in PWD, RED, Zila Panchayat, etc. Additionally, re-registering bank accounts, GST, PAN, and other documents under your mother’s name ensures she can manage tax filings and receive payments for completed or in-progress works. Legal advice is essential to navigate the procedural intricacies and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deed for Common rights on open residential land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To transfer the agricultural land from one person to 15 members, a suitable deed would be a \"Deed of Partition\" or a \"Sale Deed\" depending on whether the land is being divided into specific shares or held as an undivided interest.Deed of Partition: If the intention is to divide the land into specific shares among the 15 members, a deed of partition can be used. This would clearly outline each party’s share in the property.Sale Deed: If the land is to be held jointly as an undivided property, a sale deed transferring the ownership from the single owner to the 15 co-owners can be executed. The sale deed should specify that each of the 15 co-owners has an undivided share in the property.For the execution of the deed, a legal document needs to be drafted detailing the transfer of the land from the current owner to the 15 new co-owners. The deed should clearly mention the share of each co-owner in the property. Next final steps include, calculation of stamp duty and registration with the local sub-registrar’s office where the property is located. Once the deed is registered, the new owners should apply for the mutation of property in the revenue records to reflect the change in ownership. It’s crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure compliance with all local laws and regulations and to draft the deed accurately to avoid any future legal issues.

Given such evidence, the landlord stands a strong chance of succeeding in the eviction case. If the landlord is proceeding with redevelopment with a 60% majority consent from other tenants, this specific eviction case should not significantly hinder the process.

    "question": "Regarding maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In response to your query, the Supreme Court has established guidelines regarding the disclosure of financial status in matrimonial disputes, often emphasizing the need to file Income Tax Returns (ITRs). However, while ITRs provide an overview of income, they may not always capture the full extent of a person's earnings, especially if other financial documents suggest higher income.If your wife is running a business and you believe her actual income is significantly higher than what is reflected in her ITRs, you can request the court to order the production of additional financial documents such as bank statements, business accounts, and other relevant financial records. Courts have the discretion to ask for comprehensive financial disclosures to ensure a fair assessment of maintenance and support obligations.To strengthen your case, you should present any evidence you have that suggests her income is higher than reported. If you can obtain her bank statements or any other financial records independently, you can submit these to the court. The court can then evaluate whether her income has been underreported and adjust the maintenance accordingly.In summary, while ITRs are often required, they are not the sole documents the court may consider. The court can order additional financial disclosures if necessary to ensure a fair judgment on maintenance. It would be advisable to consult with your lawyer to strategize on gathering and presenting this evidence effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "With the death of the proprietor legally the business also ends with him, however the GST law provides a facility whereby the legal heirs can continue the business if they desire so and has provided with a detailed instructions on how such transfer shall take place. In the event of death of the proprietor its legal heirs have an option of either continuing the business or discontinuing.2)If option exercised by the legal heirs is that they will continue the business of the deceased then the following will be applicable: As per Section 29 the registration of the deceased is still liable to be cancelled. Steps to be taken by the Legal Heirs: – 1. Apply for fresh registration citing reason as Death of Proprietor and Date on which liability arises as Date of death of deceased.3)2. Section 29 allows legal heirs to file application for cancellation. Therefore, legal heirs will have to get themselves registered as Authorised Signatories in GSTIN of the deceased. 3. To be added as Authorised Signatories Amendment in Registration will not be done by the legal heirs themselves but will have to approach the jurisdictional officer. (Section 28 read with Rule 19 allows only registered person to apply for amendment registration)4. Legal Heirs will have to prove that they are the legal heirs of the deceased (Legal Heirs are defined in the personnel laws as enforced on the date).5. Transfer the business 6. Transfer ITC in the credit ledger of the deceased to the new registration by filing ITC-02 7. Apply for cancellation of the registration of deceased within 30 days and file GSTR10.In CIT v. Madhukant M. Mehta (supra) the case of the assessee was that on the death of sole proprietor the legal heirs forming partnership firm and issue was whether the firm succeeded in the business of sole proprietor, assessee is entitled to carry forward loss of sole proprietor and to set off against the income of the firm. The Gujarat High Court has taken the view as under :\"(i) that the presence of the three factors found by the Income Tax Officer was not necessarily destructive of the integrity or identity of the business so as to negative the idea of succession; (ii) that the facts showed that M had died intestate. Under section 8 of theHindu Succession Acthis property would devolve, firstly, upon the heirs being relatives specified in Class I of the Schedule. Son, daughter and widow are included in Class I. There was a clear recital in the partnership deed that the partners as heirs succeeded to the business of the deceased. The business of the deceased had been carried on even prior to the execution of the partnership deed and the partnership was brought into existence within a very short period after M's death. Having regard to all the circumstances there was succession by inheritance in this case. Merely because M's legal heirs brought into existence a firm and decided to carry on the same business under the firm name, the succession by inheritance was not lost or destroyed. The link or nexus between the business carried on by the deceased and after his death by his heirs previously as a body of heirs and subsequently as a collection of persons joined with each other by the bond of partnership was not lost either in substance or in form and the business, which the firm carried on, still remained the same business which was succeeded to by inheritance by the heirs who were partners. The assessee-firm was entitled to carry forward and set off the speculation losses of M against the income from speculation business earned during the relevant assessment years.\"The view taken by the Gujarat High Court in (1981) 132 ITR 159 (Guj) (supra) has been upheld by the Supreme Court in case of CIT v.

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "If a sole proprietor dies, their legal heirs or representatives need to manage the business and handle the legal procedures, such as cancelling the GST registration or transferring the business to their name.In the case of the death of a proprietor, the accounting treatment involves the valuation and recording of assets and liabilities, preparation of final accounts, and distribution of profits/losses among the legal heirs or representatives.In case of the death of a sole proprietor, the business can either be cancelled or transferred to the legal heirs or a new owner. Transfer of business in case of death of a sole proprietor includes obtaining legal certificates, transferring assets and liabilities, and applying for the transfer of ITC.This is because the legal heir will need to apply for a new GST registration in their own name and cannot continue the business in the name of the deceased sole proprietor due to the proprietor having a different PAN.As per Section 29 of the CGST Act, the GST registration will need to be cancelled on the death of a sole proprietor, and the business can be transferred thereafter.They need to apply for the transfer of Input Tax Credit (ITC) by filing Form GST ITC-02 on the GST common portal.As per Section 22 of the CGST Act, they need to apply for a fresh GST registration in Form GST REG-01 using their own PAN as they cannot use the existing registration of the deceased proprietor.Section 18(3) of the CGST Act, 2017 allows the transfer of ITC where the business is being transferred as long as the business’s liabilities are also being transferred in the manner specified in Rule 41.Further, section 93(1) states that if the person liable to pay tax, interest or penalty passes away, the individual who continues the deceased person’s business shall be liable to pay those tax dues.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "- A sole proprietor is a person who is a sole owner of a business and who runs that business by itself, and in case of a sole proprietorship dies then his business will immediately come to an end.- Further, as per  the Indian Succession act, after the death of the sole Proprietor, his/her legal heirs do not automatically start to inherit the old business of the deceased, but they only get to inherit the assets.- Further, the legal heirs of the deceased have the option of winding up the business after filling GST and Tax under section 29(1) and section 93(1)(b) of CGST Act, 2017.1. The bank is under obligation to transfer the entire amount to the legal heirs either by way of Nominee claim procedure or after getting required winding up documents .2. In case of transfer of business on account of death of sole proprietor, the successor shall file FORM GST ITC-02 in respect of the registration which is required to be cancelled on account of death of the sole proprietor.- Hence, you can apply for fresh registration citing reason as Death of sole Proprietor and then after the said registration you will have right to transfer the property /fund in the partnership firm.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "My father who was the sole proprietor died, have following question, please help",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Following your father's sudden demise, you face two primary challenges with his firms: the sole proprietorship and the partnership firm. For the sole proprietorship, bank accounts cannot be operated, and you must follow the nominee claim procedure, which results in account closure. However, FDRs maturing in the future and the need for debit facilities complicate matters. You may need to consult with the bank for a possible solution to keep the account active until all financial obligations are settled.For the partnership firm, transferring assets and liabilities from the sole proprietorship to the partnership firm can help. This transfer allows the partnership firm to utilize the work experience and bid capacity of the sole proprietorship for tenders in PWD, RED, Zila Panchayat, etc. Additionally, re-registering bank accounts, GST, PAN, and other documents under your mother’s name ensures she can manage tax filings and receive payments for completed or in-progress works. Legal advice is essential to navigate the procedural intricacies and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be invoked by a certificate granted by the High Court concerned under Article 132(1), 133(1) or 134 of the Constitution in respect of any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in both civil and criminal cases, involving substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. Appeals also lie to the Supreme Court in civil matters if the High Court concerned certifies : (a) that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance, and (b) that, in the opinion of the High Court, the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. In criminal cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court if the High Court (a) has on appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (b) has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any Court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (c) certified that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court. Parliament is authorised to confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgement, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

A CSR is not a criminal record rather it is more of a preliminary complaint record. Unless an FIR has been filed and legal proceedings are initiated, a CSR entry alone should not impact your passport application.Impact on Background Verification for IT Job: Most companies, especially in the IT sector, conduct background checks that include criminal record verification. Since a CSR is not a formal criminal charge, it typically does not show up in standard criminal background checks. However, if the company’s background check includes detailed police records, the CSR might come up, but it is unlikely to be a major issue unless it escalates into a formal charge.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deed for Common rights on open residential land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To transfer the agricultural land from one person to 15 members, a suitable deed would be a \"Deed of Partition\" or a \"Sale Deed\" depending on whether the land is being divided into specific shares or held as an undivided interest.Deed of Partition: If the intention is to divide the land into specific shares among the 15 members, a deed of partition can be used. This would clearly outline each party’s share in the property.Sale Deed: If the land is to be held jointly as an undivided property, a sale deed transferring the ownership from the single owner to the 15 co-owners can be executed. The sale deed should specify that each of the 15 co-owners has an undivided share in the property.For the execution of the deed, a legal document needs to be drafted detailing the transfer of the land from the current owner to the 15 new co-owners. The deed should clearly mention the share of each co-owner in the property. Next final steps include, calculation of stamp duty and registration with the local sub-registrar’s office where the property is located. Once the deed is registered, the new owners should apply for the mutation of property in the revenue records to reflect the change in ownership. It’s crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure compliance with all local laws and regulations and to draft the deed accurately to avoid any future legal issues.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the landlord of a Pagadi building plans for redevelopment and has obtained the majority consent from existing tenants, the eviction decrees already passed and pending execution can potentially be beneficial. The decreed flats, where eviction has been ordered but not yet executed, could be included in the redevelopment plan. The landlord may use these decrees to expedite the clearing of these specific flats, thus simplifying the redevelopment process. However, the landlord must comply with all legal requirements and ensure that the rights of the tenants, including those with pending eviction applications, are addressed appropriately.

    "answer": "The Pagdi system is a unique form of tenancy prevalent in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra. Under this system, tenants pay a lump sum amount to the landlord, known as the pagdi, and then pay a nominal rent for the property.The landlord can evict the tenants.They can only do so for specific reasons allowed under the law.The following are some of the reasons for which a landlord can evict a tenant in the Pagdi system: Non-payment of rent by the tenant:If the tenant fails to pay the rent on time, the landlord can initiate eviction proceedings against them.However, the redevelopment process in the Pagdi system can be complicated, with issues related to ownership, tenancy rights, and compensation.The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, lays down the procedures for redevelopment in the Pagdi system.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case of a Pagadi building where an eviction suit is pending due to the tenant not residing in the property for the last 20 years, with electricity and water disconnected for 12 years, and no rent paid or attempts to send rent, the tenant is unlikely to benefit from the redevelopment. Given such evidence, the landlord stands a strong chance of succeeding in the eviction case. If the landlord is proceeding with redevelopment with a 60% majority consent from other tenants, this specific eviction case should not significantly hinder the process. However, to avoid potential legal complications, it is advisable for the landlord to resolve the pending eviction suit before proceeding with the redevelopment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In response to your query, the Supreme Court has established guidelines regarding the disclosure of financial status in matrimonial disputes, often emphasizing the need to file Income Tax Returns (ITRs). However, while ITRs provide an overview of income, they may not always capture the full extent of a person's earnings, especially if other financial documents suggest higher income.If your wife is running a business and you believe her actual income is significantly higher than what is reflected in her ITRs, you can request the court to order the production of additional financial documents such as bank statements, business accounts, and other relevant financial records. Courts have the discretion to ask for comprehensive financial disclosures to ensure a fair assessment of maintenance and support obligations.To strengthen your case, you should present any evidence you have that suggests her income is higher than reported. If you can obtain her bank statements or any other financial records independently, you can submit these to the court. The court can then evaluate whether her income has been underreported and adjust the maintenance accordingly.In summary, while ITRs are often required, they are not the sole documents the court may consider. The court can order additional financial disclosures if necessary to ensure a fair judgment on maintenance. It would be advisable to consult with your lawyer to strategize on gathering and presenting this evidence effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can take several legal steps to protect his assets and ensure that they benefit you and your sister while giving your stepmother a fair but limited share. Firstly, he should consider creating a comprehensive will that clearly outlines the distribution of his assets. He can specify that certain properties and financial assets are to be inherited by you and your sister, ensuring that your stepmother receives only a limited portion.Secondly, he can set up a trust for you and your sister, which would manage and protect the assets from any potential claims by your stepmother. The trust can be structured to provide income or benefits to your stepmother while preserving the principal for you and your sister.Thirdly, he can change the ownership and beneficiary designations on any joint properties, financial accounts, or insurance policies to reflect his wishes. This might involve removing her as a joint owner or beneficiary and designating you and your sister instead.Lastly, your father should consult with a family law attorney to explore any legal avenues for separation or divorce if the relationship with your stepmother is untenable. This could potentially reduce her claims on his assets.By taking these steps, your father can better ensure that his wealth is distributed according to his wishes and minimize the risk of your stepmother acquiring more than her fair share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How can my father legally protect his assets from my stepmother and ensure his children inherit his wealth",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are various strategies to ensure that your stepmother cannot transfer the property to her relatives if she becomes the sole owner.If the property is held in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship your father could consider restructuring the ownership to tenants-in-common, where each owner has a defined share that can be bequeathed separately through a will. This way, your father's share can be passed directly to you or your sister, ensuring your stepmother does not become the sole owner.Your father can specify in his will that his share of the property will go to you and your sister upon his death. If the property is jointly owned, he can only bequeath his share, not the entire property. Alternatively, he could set up a trust where the property is placed, and you, your sister, and your stepmother are all beneficiaries. The trust can specify that your stepmother has the right to reside in the property for her lifetime, but cannot sell or transfer it to anyone else. After her death, the property would automatically transfer to you and your sister.Your father could include a clause in the deed with your stepmother, preventing her from selling or transferring the property without the consent of all co-owners or beneficiaries. Another option is to draft an agreement or contract with her now that explicitly states that she cannot transfer the property to anyone outside the immediate family without your consent.If your father grants her power of attorney over his affairs, he can place limitations on it, such as prohibiting the sale or transfer of the property without his consent or without following certain procedures.To implement these strategies effectively, your father should work closely with a property lawyer. The lawyer can draft the necessary documents, ensuring they are legally binding and enforceable.

    "question": "Saleability of property ignoring typo Error in GPA document registered 22 years earlier",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The error (Plot No. 15 typed as 19) needs to be addressed to ensure clear and marketable title. While your notarized affidavit provides some assurance, it might not fully satisfy legal requirements or alleviate buyer concerns. Despite the typo, the surrounding context (dimensions, boundaries, absence of Plot 19) clearly indicates that Plot 15 was intended. This is a common issue and usually can be rectified via a correction deed. However, the difficulty in tracing all heirs makes this challenging. Though tracing all heirs is difficult, it remains the most legally robust solution. Alternatively, you might be able to publish notices in newspapers and seek a court declaration for correction, simplifying the heir tracing process. For a clear title, especially for financing, legal formalities should be ideally corrected. Your uninterrupted possession for over 12 years strengthens your claim under adverse possession. While time-consuming, a declaratory suit can provide legal clarity. This would make your title indisputable, easing buyer concerns and facilitating financing. Consult with a property lawyer to explore efficient legal avenues for a correction deed or declaratory judgment.

Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is presented effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Order XVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, a court is permitted to grant adjournments if there is sufficient cause. However, as per Order XVII Rule 2, the court should not grant more than three adjournments to a party during the hearing of the suit. If the plaintiff's side has already been granted multiple adjournments, you can bring this to the notice of the court and request a limitation on further adjournments. You or your legal representative can file an application under the provisions of the CPC requesting the court to expedite the matter and limit further adjournments. Formally file an application requesting the court to limit further adjournments, emphasizing that sufficient time has already been granted to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff continues to seek extensions without sufficient cause, seek the court's intervention to prevent further delays and to expedite the proceedings. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A Community Service Register (CSR) entry is typically an informal record used by the police to document minor complaints that do not necessarily warrant an FIR (First Information Report).Impact on Passport Application: During the passport application process, police verification is conducted to check for any criminal records. A CSR is not a criminal record rather it is more of a preliminary complaint record. Unless an FIR has been filed and legal proceedings are initiated, a CSR entry alone should not impact your passport application.Impact on Background Verification for IT Job: Most companies, especially in the IT sector, conduct background checks that include criminal record verification. Since a CSR is not a formal criminal charge, it typically does not show up in standard criminal background checks. However, if the company’s background check includes detailed police records, the CSR might come up, but it is unlikely to be a major issue unless it escalates into a formal charge.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "1. Transferring Ownership with an Ongoing Home Loan:It is possible to transfer ownership of a property even when a home loan is ongoing. There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications.

Instead, focus on legal routes for eviction and regaining possession of your property. While court cases can be time-consuming, a well-prepared case can result in an eviction order. Ensure all documents and evidence proving your ownership and the illegal occupation are well-documented and presented. Request the police for immediate eviction of the illegal occupants. In some cases, the court can grant a temporary injunction to prevent the occupier from staying in the property during the trial. Any threats from the trespasser should be reported to the police immediately, which could lead to additional charges against them.

    "question": "How can my father legally protect his assets from my stepmother and ensure his children inherit his wealth",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can take several legal steps to protect his assets and ensure that they benefit you and your sister while giving your stepmother a fair but limited share. Firstly, he should consider creating a comprehensive will that clearly outlines the distribution of his assets. He can specify that certain properties and financial assets are to be inherited by you and your sister, ensuring that your stepmother receives only a limited portion.Secondly, he can set up a trust for you and your sister, which would manage and protect the assets from any potential claims by your stepmother. The trust can be structured to provide income or benefits to your stepmother while preserving the principal for you and your sister.Thirdly, he can change the ownership and beneficiary designations on any joint properties, financial accounts, or insurance policies to reflect his wishes. This might involve removing her as a joint owner or beneficiary and designating you and your sister instead.Lastly, your father should consult with a family law attorney to explore any legal avenues for separation or divorce if the relationship with your stepmother is untenable. This could potentially reduce her claims on his assets.By taking these steps, your father can better ensure that his wealth is distributed according to his wishes and minimize the risk of your stepmother acquiring more than her fair share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How can my father legally protect his assets from my stepmother and ensure his children inherit his wealth",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are various strategies to ensure that your stepmother cannot transfer the property to her relatives if she becomes the sole owner.If the property is held in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship your father could consider restructuring the ownership to tenants-in-common, where each owner has a defined share that can be bequeathed separately through a will. This way, your father's share can be passed directly to you or your sister, ensuring your stepmother does not become the sole owner.Your father can specify in his will that his share of the property will go to you and your sister upon his death. If the property is jointly owned, he can only bequeath his share, not the entire property. Alternatively, he could set up a trust where the property is placed, and you, your sister, and your stepmother are all beneficiaries. The trust can specify that your stepmother has the right to reside in the property for her lifetime, but cannot sell or transfer it to anyone else. After her death, the property would automatically transfer to you and your sister.Your father could include a clause in the deed with your stepmother, preventing her from selling or transferring the property without the consent of all co-owners or beneficiaries. Another option is to draft an agreement or contract with her now that explicitly states that she cannot transfer the property to anyone outside the immediate family without your consent.If your father grants her power of attorney over his affairs, he can place limitations on it, such as prohibiting the sale or transfer of the property without his consent or without following certain procedures.To implement these strategies effectively, your father should work closely with a property lawyer. The lawyer can draft the necessary documents, ensuring they are legally binding and enforceable.

    "question": "Regarding maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In response to your query, the Supreme Court has established guidelines regarding the disclosure of financial status in matrimonial disputes, often emphasizing the need to file Income Tax Returns (ITRs). However, while ITRs provide an overview of income, they may not always capture the full extent of a person's earnings, especially if other financial documents suggest higher income.If your wife is running a business and you believe her actual income is significantly higher than what is reflected in her ITRs, you can request the court to order the production of additional financial documents such as bank statements, business accounts, and other relevant financial records. Courts have the discretion to ask for comprehensive financial disclosures to ensure a fair assessment of maintenance and support obligations.To strengthen your case, you should present any evidence you have that suggests her income is higher than reported. If you can obtain her bank statements or any other financial records independently, you can submit these to the court. The court can then evaluate whether her income has been underreported and adjust the maintenance accordingly.In summary, while ITRs are often required, they are not the sole documents the court may consider. The court can order additional financial disclosures if necessary to ensure a fair judgment on maintenance. It would be advisable to consult with your lawyer to strategize on gathering and presenting this evidence effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A CSR is not a criminal record rather it is more of a preliminary complaint record. Unless an FIR has been filed and legal proceedings are initiated, a CSR entry alone should not impact your passport application.Impact on Background Verification for IT Job: Most companies, especially in the IT sector, conduct background checks that include criminal record verification. Since a CSR is not a formal criminal charge, it typically does not show up in standard criminal background checks. However, if the company’s background check includes detailed police records, the CSR might come up, but it is unlikely to be a major issue unless it escalates into a formal charge.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

For example in Maharashtra most family Courts have it included in the formats.You can file a separate application seeking the production of documents and asking for 2 to 3 years of bank statements and related documents, in case she is not  submitting despite the application your side can request the Court to consider her refusal to submit the same against her, as a plea of an adverse inference.Thresiamma G.

    "question": "Regarding maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In response to your query, the Supreme Court has established guidelines regarding the disclosure of financial status in matrimonial disputes, often emphasizing the need to file Income Tax Returns (ITRs). However, while ITRs provide an overview of income, they may not always capture the full extent of a person's earnings, especially if other financial documents suggest higher income.If your wife is running a business and you believe her actual income is significantly higher than what is reflected in her ITRs, you can request the court to order the production of additional financial documents such as bank statements, business accounts, and other relevant financial records. Courts have the discretion to ask for comprehensive financial disclosures to ensure a fair assessment of maintenance and support obligations.To strengthen your case, you should present any evidence you have that suggests her income is higher than reported. If you can obtain her bank statements or any other financial records independently, you can submit these to the court. The court can then evaluate whether her income has been underreported and adjust the maintenance accordingly.In summary, while ITRs are often required, they are not the sole documents the court may consider. The court can order additional financial disclosures if necessary to ensure a fair judgment on maintenance. It would be advisable to consult with your lawyer to strategize on gathering and presenting this evidence effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The GIDC is incorrect by quoting that the lease is less than 10 years because you have not leased out the property to Religare Finvest, instead you obtained mortgage loan and the same has been fully discharged, the original documents in your possession will establish the facts pleaded.Now you are actually transferring the leasehold rights to the new buyer for equal number of years if not more, therefore the rule of charging 5% towards the transfer fee is the only law applicable  hence the arbitral rule now made by the GIDC can be challenged in the high court by filing a writ petition.

    "question": "GIDC charging 25% Transfer Fee instead of 5% for 20+ years of lease ownership while transfer.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your dispute with GIDC over the lease transfer fee is based on the interpretation of the lease transfer policy. You argue that the fee should be calculated from the original 2004 lease date, qualifying for a 5% transfer fee, as the internal financial transactions with Religare Finvest Ltd. and India Resurgent Fund ARC do not constitute a change in ownership. These transactions were for mortgage management and should not affect the lease's tenure.To challenge GIDC's decision, gather all relevant documents, including the original lease agreement and mortgage documents. Highlight that the leaseholder has remained the same since 2004 and submit a formal request to GIDC for a recalculation based on the original lease date. Engage a property lawyer to draft a legal notice if GIDC does not respond favourably. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the relevant regulatory authority. Research previous similar cases to strengthen your position.Your argument for the 5% fee based on the 2004 lease date is valid.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2.

Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4.

The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

    "question": "Saleability of property ignoring typo Error in GPA document registered 22 years earlier",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The error (Plot No. 15 typed as 19) needs to be addressed to ensure clear and marketable title. While your notarized affidavit provides some assurance, it might not fully satisfy legal requirements or alleviate buyer concerns. Despite the typo, the surrounding context (dimensions, boundaries, absence of Plot 19) clearly indicates that Plot 15 was intended. This is a common issue and usually can be rectified via a correction deed. However, the difficulty in tracing all heirs makes this challenging. Though tracing all heirs is difficult, it remains the most legally robust solution. Alternatively, you might be able to publish notices in newspapers and seek a court declaration for correction, simplifying the heir tracing process. For a clear title, especially for financing, legal formalities should be ideally corrected. Your uninterrupted possession for over 12 years strengthens your claim under adverse possession. While time-consuming, a declaratory suit can provide legal clarity. This would make your title indisputable, easing buyer concerns and facilitating financing. Consult with a property lawyer to explore efficient legal avenues for a correction deed or declaratory judgment.

    "question": "CSR filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A Community Service Register (CSR) entry is typically an informal record used by the police to document minor complaints that do not necessarily warrant an FIR (First Information Report).Impact on Passport Application: During the passport application process, police verification is conducted to check for any criminal records. A CSR is not a criminal record rather it is more of a preliminary complaint record. Unless an FIR has been filed and legal proceedings are initiated, a CSR entry alone should not impact your passport application.Impact on Background Verification for IT Job: Most companies, especially in the IT sector, conduct background checks that include criminal record verification. Since a CSR is not a formal criminal charge, it typically does not show up in standard criminal background checks. However, if the company’s background check includes detailed police records, the CSR might come up, but it is unlikely to be a major issue unless it escalates into a formal charge.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So you can basically follow these steps:Legal Action: Since both the builder and the maintenance agency are running unfair trade practices to reject entry for non- payment of club usage charges, you should think about lodging a complaint with the Consumer Forum. It can address unfair trade practices and harassment issues and can offer remedies, including monetary damages.District Magistrate Follow-Up: As you reported your grievance to the District Magistrate, who has forwarded the same to the ADM (Executive), follow up your complaint with the Office of the ADM and insistently enquire about the action taken on their part. Provide them with copies of any related papers and materials, including the previous communication and decisions made.Police Involvement: In case of further aggravation, then visit the local police station with a complaint along with Documentary evidence along the directives of the District Magistrtate’s office and the show cause notice issued under Disaster Management Act. Defend the FIR by having the proof for harassment and denial of access.Model Tenancy Act: To ensure tenure security of tenants, avail the provisions of the Model Tenancy Act, implemented by UP. Home; Ontario Provincial Complaints; Provincial Complaints Ontario; File a complaint with the Rent Authority of the Deputy Collector citing the specific problem and demanding action to protect the rights of tenants without excessive harassment.Public Grievance Portal: If necessary, appeal the matter through the Chief Minister, Office or through the Public Grievance Portal again.

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is legally possible to pursue two cases in two different courts at the same time. The suit filed against you in November 2023 for the recovery of the amount of money is a suit of financial claim, whereas the possible shift of forum to the Consumer Forum at the NCDRC level would be for relief for mental harassment and a money claim for the denial of the tenant's entry. These are two different problems that can be solved at once in separate courts.Step 1: Acquiring redress through the consumer forum requires making your argument for mental harassment for tenant entry denial and the resulting harm. If you wish, based on the circumstances obtained and receiving cooperation from the magistrate’s office, you may contact the Consumer Forum to seek help and request a faster processing of this case since the magistrate is involved and there are continuous losses arising from the vacant property.Step 2: It may also be appropriate to institute a new claim or apply for an injunction order under Section CrPC 200 to compel the magistrate to launch an investigation and make a tenant entry order expeditiously. By adopting this strategy, you will also avoid more regrets like the current one involving the loss of more money on the dilapidated building and hasten the process of getting justice for your claims.It is best to seek advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable about property and consumer laws so they can give advice that would reflect details regarding the case so that the appropriate legal measures to safeguard the rights of the consumers can be implemented during the said process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "In my view what the builder or maintenance company or whosoever is in charge, wants, is the maintenance charges for maintenance of the club house, regardless of the fact that the same is used by the flat purchasers or notIf above is the case then the flat buyers would be bound by their respective agreements/contracts with the builder,  so far the club house is concernedSo take for example,  there is a swimming pool. Not all use it. But still it is required to be maintained. So a flat buyer cannot be heard to say, that,  look, I don't use the pool,  so I won't pay for it. Another example would be the lift.If the builder is preventing the flat owners from letting their flats on rent to tenants and denying access to tenants then that is certainly illegal. Once the flat is allotted on ownership basis or in your case on 90 years exclusive lease basis, then absent any Condition in the contract,  between the builder and flat buyer, the builder cannot stop the flat owners' tenants from entering the premisesSo the affected flat owners can certainly approach the consumer forum.The ongoing case for recovery that is filed by the builder,  would have no bearing on the above case that would be filed by the flat owners with the Consumer forum.As regards the hierarchy of consumer forum, the case has to be filed with the District Commission.A Magistrate court does not have the power to enforce payment of damages by the builder for the losses sustained by  the flat owners due to the builder's denial of access to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Registration of parking space",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When purchasing a flat that includes an open parking space, it is important to ensure that the parking allotment is properly transferred to your name. Here are the steps and considerations:First, verify that the seller has legal rights to the parking space through the allotment letter from the builder. This letter should explicitly mention the parking space number and its allocation to the seller.Next, include the details of the open parking space in the sale agreement. This ensures that the parking space is legally recognized as part of the property you are purchasing.Although open parking spaces are not typically registered separately, you should obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the builder or the housing society, confirming the transfer of the parking space to your name.Regarding the valuation of the property, the details of the open parking space should be included in the overall valuation. While open parking may not significantly increase the property’s value, it is a valuable amenity that can affect the total worth and appeal of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In response to your query, the Supreme Court has established guidelines regarding the disclosure of financial status in matrimonial disputes, often emphasizing the need to file Income Tax Returns (ITRs). However, while ITRs provide an overview of income, they may not always capture the full extent of a person's earnings, especially if other financial documents suggest higher income.If your wife is running a business and you believe her actual income is significantly higher than what is reflected in her ITRs, you can request the court to order the production of additional financial documents such as bank statements, business accounts, and other relevant financial records. Courts have the discretion to ask for comprehensive financial disclosures to ensure a fair assessment of maintenance and support obligations.To strengthen your case, you should present any evidence you have that suggests her income is higher than reported. If you can obtain her bank statements or any other financial records independently, you can submit these to the court. The court can then evaluate whether her income has been underreported and adjust the maintenance accordingly.In summary, while ITRs are often required, they are not the sole documents the court may consider. The court can order additional financial disclosures if necessary to ensure a fair judgment on maintenance. It would be advisable to consult with your lawyer to strategize on gathering and presenting this evidence effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You have to do that as a party in personSo please get over your obsession that the SLP would be rejected by the SC using its discretionary powers and FILE A SLP if you are really aggrieved.

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

    "question": "Saleability of property ignoring typo Error in GPA document registered 22 years earlier",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The error (Plot No. 15 typed as 19) needs to be addressed to ensure clear and marketable title. While your notarized affidavit provides some assurance, it might not fully satisfy legal requirements or alleviate buyer concerns. Despite the typo, the surrounding context (dimensions, boundaries, absence of Plot 19) clearly indicates that Plot 15 was intended. This is a common issue and usually can be rectified via a correction deed. However, the difficulty in tracing all heirs makes this challenging. Though tracing all heirs is difficult, it remains the most legally robust solution. Alternatively, you might be able to publish notices in newspapers and seek a court declaration for correction, simplifying the heir tracing process. For a clear title, especially for financing, legal formalities should be ideally corrected. Your uninterrupted possession for over 12 years strengthens your claim under adverse possession. While time-consuming, a declaratory suit can provide legal clarity. This would make your title indisputable, easing buyer concerns and facilitating financing. Consult with a property lawyer to explore efficient legal avenues for a correction deed or declaratory judgment.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Consult a legal expert to review the validity of the unregistered contracts and the implications of the ongoing court cases. Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is presented effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Certain significant modifications have been brought forth by the Act of 2019 concerning the pecuniary jurisdiction for all the forums i.e. the District, State, and National Commissions, respectively:The upper limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the District Commission has been increased from Rs.20,00, 000 to Rs.100,00,000 as per Section 34,Consumer Protection Act, 2019.The limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the State Commission  has been increased from Rs.100,00,000 to Rs.10,00,00,000 as per Section 47,Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and,The limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the National Commission has been increased from above Rs.10,00,00,000 to above Rs.10,00,00,000 as per Section 58,Consumer Protection Act, 2019.These modifications have widened the scope of pecuniary jurisdiction to a much larger extent. Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant. This was held in the case of “M/s Pyaridevi Chabiraj Steels Pvt. Ltd. v. National Insurance Corporation Ltd.Therefore you can file the case in the district commission itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Commission is determined by the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, not the compensation claimed. Since the hospital bill (the value of the services paid as consideration) is ₹26 lakhs, it falls within the jurisdiction of the District Consumer Forum, which handles cases where the value does not exceed ₹1 crore.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

    "question": "Saleability of property ignoring typo Error in GPA document registered 22 years earlier",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The error (Plot No. 15 typed as 19) needs to be addressed to ensure clear and marketable title. While your notarized affidavit provides some assurance, it might not fully satisfy legal requirements or alleviate buyer concerns. Despite the typo, the surrounding context (dimensions, boundaries, absence of Plot 19) clearly indicates that Plot 15 was intended. This is a common issue and usually can be rectified via a correction deed. However, the difficulty in tracing all heirs makes this challenging. Though tracing all heirs is difficult, it remains the most legally robust solution. Alternatively, you might be able to publish notices in newspapers and seek a court declaration for correction, simplifying the heir tracing process. For a clear title, especially for financing, legal formalities should be ideally corrected. Your uninterrupted possession for over 12 years strengthens your claim under adverse possession. While time-consuming, a declaratory suit can provide legal clarity. This would make your title indisputable, easing buyer concerns and facilitating financing. Consult with a property lawyer to explore efficient legal avenues for a correction deed or declaratory judgment. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,To address the issue effectively, press the police to take swift action since an FIR has already been filed. Your mother's statement is crucial, so arrange for her to return to India as soon as possible to provide her testimony. Consider hiring a new attorney with experience in property disputes and criminal trespass if your current lawyer is not effectively advocating for you. Ensure that this new attorney pushes for immediate police action and legal remedies.Temporarily cutting the electricity might be seen as harassment and could backfire legally. Instead, focus on legal routes for eviction and regaining possession of your property. While court cases can be time-consuming, a well-prepared case can result in an eviction order. Ensure all documents and evidence proving your ownership and the illegal occupation are well-documented and presented. Request the police for immediate eviction of the illegal occupants. In some cases, the court can grant a temporary injunction to prevent the occupier from staying in the property during the trial. Any threats from the trespasser should be reported to the police immediately, which could lead to additional charges against them. By following these steps, you should be able to reclaim your property and ensure justice is served.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-The writ of certiorari is used by the Supreme Court and the High Courts to quash the orders passed by the lower courts when they have overstepped their jurisdiction, violated the principles of natural justice, or have made an error of law.- Hence, you can file a writ of certiorari before the Supreme Court , if the High has violated the principle of natural justice at the time of passing that order.- However, as the judgement passed at that final stage of RSA, then no certificate can be issued by the Court at this stage.- Better to file writ of certiorari before the SC as the court may not go in details in SLP.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "A body is said to have acted beyond its jurisdiction in the following cases:Where the court considering the matter has not been constituted properly as per the law, like the requirements of members, etc.Where the subject matter of inquiry lies beyond the scope of the body’s powers as per the law.When the jurisdiction has been based on a wrong assumption of facts.When there is a failure of justice due to violation of principles of natural justice or presence of elements like fraud, collusion, or corruption.Even though the body has acted well within the limits of its jurisdiction, a decision can be quashed if there is a blatant error prima facie. The error here means an error of law.Thus, in all the above-mentioned cases, a writ of certiorari can be issued.Your case do not fall under the category hence you may once again analyze the issue properly and take decision accordinglyT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

This petition is based on the substantial questions of law involved and potential violations of constitutional rights, such as the right to an inhabitable shelter and privacy.To appeal to the SC, you may need a certificate from the HC under Articles 132, 133, or 134, which requires filing an application in the HC, highlighting the significant legal issues. Additionally, if the HC judgement violates your fundamental rights, you can file a writ petition directly with the SC under Article 32.Consulting with a legal expert specialising in constitutional and property law is advisable.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

    "answer": "It is advisable to engage a lawyer as he/she is aware of the nuances of the judicial system. By learning the provisions of law and judgments alone, one cannot assume that they are capable of presenting the case. For the sake of money and to get hold of clients, many may come forward to do the drafting and filing, however, clear cut understanding of the law, judges and tackle the case as per judge's mind is an art which is difficult to grab unless one practices regularly.Unless you provide the backdrop of the case and the order, it will be difficult to provide advice.G.RajaganapathyAdvocate,High Court of Madras.Rajaganapathy GanesanAdvocate, Chennai2270 Answers8 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Rajaganapathy Ganesan"

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be invoked by a certificate granted by the High Court concerned under Article 132(1), 133(1) or 134 of the Constitution in respect of any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in both civil and criminal cases, involving substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. Appeals also lie to the Supreme Court in civil matters if the High Court concerned certifies : (a) that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance, and (b) that, in the opinion of the High Court, the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. In criminal cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court if the High Court (a) has on appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (b) has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any Court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (c) certified that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court. Parliament is authorised to confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgement, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

    "question": "Tenant rights in a pugree building build by a builder based on leased land taken from landowner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As a tenant under the Pugree system in a building in Thane, Maharashtra, purchased by your father in 1984, you are now facing issues due to the expiration of the builder's lease with the landowner. Given the situation, you need to decide on several key points.First, regarding the payment of rent, since the builder's lease with the landowner has expired and the landowner has issued a notice, it is appropriate to start paying the rent or any agreed-upon amount to the landowner directly, as they now have the overriding legal interest in the property.Second, you can consider entering into an agreement directly with the landowner, bypassing the builder. This is especially pertinent since the landowner has expressed an intention not to renew the lease with the builder and is willing to provide you with an ownership agreement. Ensure that any agreement with the landowner includes clear terms about the conversion to ownership and the handling of the land rights.Third, if the builder does not agree to the landowner's terms for relinquishing their rights, you, as a tenant, should prioritise legal clarity and the long-term security of your tenancy. Entering into an agreement with the landowner directly can provide this security. However, ensure that this agreement is legally binding and considers any potential claims the builder might have.Lastly, if the landowner insists on vacating the premises unless you enter into a lease agreement with them, you should seek legal advice to fully understand your rights and options. The landowner does have the legal right to renegotiate terms with you directly since the builder's lease has expired.In summary, your options include paying rent to the landowner, negotiating an ownership agreement with the landowner, and potentially bypassing the builder if they do not cooperate.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is possible to sell or transfer property to a trust in Chennai from abroad, including from the USA.First, you need to execute a Power of Attorney (PoA) in favour of a trusted person in India who can act on your behalf. The POA should be notarized and attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA. This document grants your representative the authority to manage, sell, or transfer your property according to your instructions.Next, your representative in India can handle the legal procedures required for the property transaction. This includes drafting and executing the sale deed or transfer deed and completing the registration process with the relevant authorities in Chennai.Ensure all documents are duly verified and comply with Indian legal requirements to avoid any complications. Consulting with a legal expert in India who specialises in property law is advisable to ensure a smooth and compliant transaction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be invoked by a certificate granted by the High Court concerned under Article 132(1), 133(1) or 134 of the Constitution in respect of any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in both civil and criminal cases, involving substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. Appeals also lie to the Supreme Court in civil matters if the High Court concerned certifies : (a) that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance, and (b) that, in the opinion of the High Court, the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. In criminal cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court if the High Court (a) has on appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (b) has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any Court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (c) certified that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court. Parliament is authorised to confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgement, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is presented effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The property's ownership history from 2014 to 2023 is clear in the EC records.BDA Acquisition: The RTC records show the land as acquired by BDA, but there is no clear evidence from RTI or a visible case status in the city civil court. This discrepancy needs resolution.Registration without BDA Allotment: Registering BDA-acquired land without an allotment letter or possession certificate is typically not possible, as BDA needs to issue these documents to validate the transaction.Checking Court Details and BDA Status: To get details of the city civil court case, you can visit the court in person or consult with a lawyer who can access these records. To verify if the land is still under BDA control, you may need to visit the BDA office or seek help from a legal expert.BDA Rules on Unauthorised Ownership: If BDA has not vacated unauthorised owners within the stipulated period (2–5 years), they might not have active control or authority over the land currently.

    "question": "I have purchased site but BDA notification says this land is acquired by BDA",
    "answer": "- As per law, the government cannot acquire any private land without sending a notice to the owner of the land and also without publishing the proposal in the two news papers.- Further, without deciding the compensation and paying the same, the government department cannot take possession of the land for the specified purposes like construction of road etc.- As per the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007, the payment for acquired land must be made within one year from the date of the declaration, and the Collector can extend this time limit by six months with a penalty of 5% per month, and further if payment has not been made within one year nor has the Collector granted an extension, the land acquisition proceedings shall lapse.- Since, you have sale deed in your name , then you are the absolute owner of the land , and BDA cannot acquire without serving a notice to you- Further, as there is no details of acquired by the BDA and even no case is pending or disposed by the Court , it means the land is not acquired by the BDA completely.- You can enquire from the BDA site about the said land , and take help of any local lawyer for getting details of that land.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be invoked by a certificate granted by the High Court concerned under Article 132(1), 133(1) or 134 of the Constitution in respect of any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in both civil and criminal cases, involving substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. Appeals also lie to the Supreme Court in civil matters if the High Court concerned certifies : (a) that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance, and (b) that, in the opinion of the High Court, the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. In criminal cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court if the High Court (a) has on appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (b) has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any Court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused and sentenced him to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than 10 years, or (c) certified that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court. Parliament is authorised to confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to entertain and hear appeals from any judgement, final order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You can consider filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC) to challenge the High Court (HC) judgement on the grounds of violating fundamental rights like privacy and the right to an inhabitable shelter.1. The HC judgement directing the construction of a boundary wall close to your building wall can be contested as it hinders necessary access and ventilation, impacting living conditions.2. Highlight the potential danger of soil excavation near the building foundation, which could cause settlement issues and collapse, against the Panchayat's setback recommendations.3. Argue that the proximity of the boundary wall to windows and ventilators compromises privacy, violating fundamental rights.4. Point out that the HC judgement contradicts municipal or panchayat building rules, mandating setbacks.If the writ petition is not accepted, you can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136. The rejection of a writ petition does not prevent you from filing an SLP.A writ petition is likely to be accepted due to fundamental rights and legal errors, while an SLP, though discretionary, can also succeed if significant legal issues are demonstrated.You can file one review petition if the SLP is rejected, usually reviewed by the same or a different bench.Both the writ petition and the SLP can request a stay on the HC judgement to maintain the status quo regarding the boundary wall construction.Filing a writ petition first provides a structured approach, and if unsuccessful, pursuing an SLP offers another avenue for redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Scope of Certiorari in SC Civil writ - to quash the High court judgement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Pursuing multiple legal options sequentially is not inherently an abuse of law, especially when fundamental rights are at stake and there is a serious error in judgment at the High Court (HC) level. The legal system allows for various remedies to ensure justice is served, provided that each remedy is pursued in good faith and within the legal framework. Article 136 of theConstitution of India, allows any party to appeal to the Supreme Court against any judgment, decree, or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. It is a discretionary power of the SC. If the HC judgment violates panchayat law or building rules, you can file an SLP citing these legal errors. Article 32 of theConstitution of India, guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. If your SLP is rejected, you can file a writ petition on different grounds, such as the violation of fundamental rights to residence, privacy, and easement rights. This would be a different legal argument and thus, not an abuse of the legal process. You can also obtain a certificate from the HC under Articles 133 or 134 if substantial questions of law are involved. By adhering to these strategies, you can maximize the chances of having your case heard and rectifying the HC judgment that you believe violates fundamental rights and municipal norms.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The managing committee is responsible for the maintenance and repair of common areas, including flooring and false ceilings in passage areas. Your repeated requests for repairs put the society on notice of the issue. If the society failed to take action, it neglected its duties. The urgent repair you did shows that you acted with the concern of other flat owners and notified the society, which indicates that you attempted to act responsibly. It is advisable to respond to the notice clearly stating the series of events, your repeated requests for repair, the lack of response from the society, and your eventual decision to undertake the repairs with the consent of other flat owners. Express your willingness to discuss the matter amicably with the society and suggest a meeting to resolve the issue. If the society does not respond positively, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The Registrar has the authority to adjudicate disputes between members and the managing committee. As a last resort, if the society threatens legal action or if you need to assert your rights, you may consider seeking legal counsel to file a suit against the society for failing to maintain common areas.

    "question": "Tenant rights in a pugree building build by a builder based on leased land taken from landowner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As a tenant under the Pugree system in a building in Thane, Maharashtra, purchased by your father in 1984, you are now facing issues due to the expiration of the builder's lease with the landowner. Given the situation, you need to decide on several key points.First, regarding the payment of rent, since the builder's lease with the landowner has expired and the landowner has issued a notice, it is appropriate to start paying the rent or any agreed-upon amount to the landowner directly, as they now have the overriding legal interest in the property.Second, you can consider entering into an agreement directly with the landowner, bypassing the builder. This is especially pertinent since the landowner has expressed an intention not to renew the lease with the builder and is willing to provide you with an ownership agreement. Ensure that any agreement with the landowner includes clear terms about the conversion to ownership and the handling of the land rights.Third, if the builder does not agree to the landowner's terms for relinquishing their rights, you, as a tenant, should prioritise legal clarity and the long-term security of your tenancy. Entering into an agreement with the landowner directly can provide this security. However, ensure that this agreement is legally binding and considers any potential claims the builder might have.Lastly, if the landowner insists on vacating the premises unless you enter into a lease agreement with them, you should seek legal advice to fully understand your rights and options. The landowner does have the legal right to renegotiate terms with you directly since the builder's lease has expired.In summary, your options include paying rent to the landowner, negotiating an ownership agreement with the landowner, and potentially bypassing the builder if they do not cooperate.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This discrepancy needs resolution.Registration without BDA Allotment: Registering BDA-acquired land without an allotment letter or possession certificate is typically not possible, as BDA needs to issue these documents to validate the transaction.Checking Court Details and BDA Status: To get details of the city civil court case, you can visit the court in person or consult with a lawyer who can access these records. To verify if the land is still under BDA control, you may need to visit the BDA office or seek help from a legal expert.BDA Rules on Unauthorised Ownership: If BDA has not vacated unauthorised owners within the stipulated period (2–5 years), they might not have active control or authority over the land currently. However, confirming this with official records is essential.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I have purchased site but BDA notification says this land is acquired by BDA",
    "answer": "- As per law, the government cannot acquire any private land without sending a notice to the owner of the land and also without publishing the proposal in the two news papers.- Further, without deciding the compensation and paying the same, the government department cannot take possession of the land for the specified purposes like construction of road etc.- As per the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007, the payment for acquired land must be made within one year from the date of the declaration, and the Collector can extend this time limit by six months with a penalty of 5% per month, and further if payment has not been made within one year nor has the Collector granted an extension, the land acquisition proceedings shall lapse.- Since, you have sale deed in your name , then you are the absolute owner of the land , and BDA cannot acquire without serving a notice to you- Further, as there is no details of acquired by the BDA and even no case is pending or disposed by the Court , it means the land is not acquired by the BDA completely.- You can enquire from the BDA site about the said land , and take help of any local lawyer for getting details of that land.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Tenant rights in a pugree building build by a builder based on leased land taken from landowner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As a tenant under the Pugree system in a building in Thane, Maharashtra, purchased by your father in 1984, you are now facing issues due to the expiration of the builder's lease with the landowner. Given the situation, you need to decide on several key points.First, regarding the payment of rent, since the builder's lease with the landowner has expired and the landowner has issued a notice, it is appropriate to start paying the rent or any agreed-upon amount to the landowner directly, as they now have the overriding legal interest in the property.Second, you can consider entering into an agreement directly with the landowner, bypassing the builder. This is especially pertinent since the landowner has expressed an intention not to renew the lease with the builder and is willing to provide you with an ownership agreement. Ensure that any agreement with the landowner includes clear terms about the conversion to ownership and the handling of the land rights.Third, if the builder does not agree to the landowner's terms for relinquishing their rights, you, as a tenant, should prioritise legal clarity and the long-term security of your tenancy. Entering into an agreement with the landowner directly can provide this security. However, ensure that this agreement is legally binding and considers any potential claims the builder might have.Lastly, if the landowner insists on vacating the premises unless you enter into a lease agreement with them, you should seek legal advice to fully understand your rights and options. The landowner does have the legal right to renegotiate terms with you directly since the builder's lease has expired.In summary, your options include paying rent to the landowner, negotiating an ownership agreement with the landowner, and potentially bypassing the builder if they do not cooperate.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I 10-year lease my property to wife/relative & they can rent for 11 months to other tenants?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You can indeed lease your property to your wife or relative for a long-term 10-year period and allow them to sublease it to tenants for shorter 11 months periods. For a 10-year lease you won’t require any automatic renewal clause. However, for a 11-month sublease creating an 11-month lease with an automatic renewal clause can simplify the process. Using a Power of Attorney (POA) is another method to manage your property while you are abroad. You can execute a POA in favor of your wife/relative, granting them the authority to manage and lease the property on your behalf. If you are in the United States, the POA should be notarized in the US and then attested by the Indian Consulate or Embassy. As far as tax implication is concerned if you lease your property to your wife/relative, they will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income they receive from subtenants. However, if you use a POA, you will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income collected by the POA holder on your behalf.

    "context": "Asked 11 months ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Child custody for a father",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the age of your son, courts generally prefer to keep children, especially young ones, with their mother, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. However, as the father, you have the right to seek custody and visitation. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in custody cases. For visitation rights, you can file a petition for interim relief to ensure regular visitation rights. Given the close proximity of your homes, the court might grant you regular visitation or even shared custody, where your son can spend time with both parents. The court can also grant you overnight stays or weekend visits, depending on the specific circumstances and the child's best interests. As far as the maintenance of your wife and child is concerned, under Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC), your wife can claim maintenance if she is unable to maintain herself. However, you may argue that she has voluntarily left the matrimonial home without sufficient reason and that you have made multiple efforts to reconcile and bring her back. This could influence the court's decision on granting maintenance. As a father, you are legally obligated to provide for your child's education and general well-being. This includes financial support, which you are already providing. Keeping documented records of your attempts to reconcile with your wife and financial contributions towards your son's education and other expenses might help you in your case for custody of the child. Further, a family law attorney can guide you through the process of filing for custody and securing visitation rights.

Contact your UPI payment service provider to report the transaction and explain the situation, as they may have procedures to address fraudulent transactions or disputes. Visit your local police station and file a formal complaint, providing all the evidence you have.The police can investigate the matter and take action against the individual. File a complaint with consumer protection agencies or forums, which can mediate disputes between consumers and service providers and help in resolving the issue. If other steps do not yield results, consider consulting a lawyer to explore legal action, such as filing a case in small claims court.

    "answer": "Dear Client,This basically means that the parties do not have to retire all cases and incur the expenses of depositing assets before approaching the courts for amutual consent divorce. The procedure for filing amutual consent divorceusually entails completing a petition where both spouses agree on aspects such as property division and child issues, including custody, among others. It should be filed alongside the divorce cases or soon afterward, especially when amutual consent divorcehas been tendered on the first occasion, to make sure that both parties respect the agreed-upon timelines.In amutual consent divorce, if you give up property and dismiss claims prior to the process being completed, he may infringe on the MOU. To be safe from this, you should ensure the MOU is very specific, professionally written and/or advised, and then signed. It should also incorporate clauses that safeguard you, as provided below. For instance, you can provide that the transfer of assets and the withdrawal of the cases will only be to them after the first motion is granted, provided that all the actions are done simultaneously and in a legally documented way.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

First, gather all evidence, including UPI transaction details, WhatsApp chat records, and any other communication or receipts related to the transaction. This documentation will be crucial for any legal or formal proceedings.Try reaching him through other means, such as email or social media, or ask mutual contacts for assistance. Contact your UPI payment service provider to report the transaction and explain the situation, as they may have procedures to address fraudulent transactions or disputes. Visit your local police station and file a formal complaint, providing all the evidence you have.The police can investigate the matter and take action against the individual. File a complaint with consumer protection agencies or forums, which can mediate disputes between consumers and service providers and help in resolving the issue. If other steps do not yield results, consider consulting a lawyer to explore legal action, such as filing a case in small claims court. Taking these steps promptly can increase your chances of recovering your money and preventing further issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child custody for a father",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the age of your son, courts generally prefer to keep children, especially young ones, with their mother, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. However, as the father, you have the right to seek custody and visitation. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in custody cases. For visitation rights, you can file a petition for interim relief to ensure regular visitation rights. Given the close proximity of your homes, the court might grant you regular visitation or even shared custody, where your son can spend time with both parents. The court can also grant you overnight stays or weekend visits, depending on the specific circumstances and the child's best interests. As far as the maintenance of your wife and child is concerned, under Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC), your wife can claim maintenance if she is unable to maintain herself. However, you may argue that she has voluntarily left the matrimonial home without sufficient reason and that you have made multiple efforts to reconcile and bring her back. This could influence the court's decision on granting maintenance. As a father, you are legally obligated to provide for your child's education and general well-being. This includes financial support, which you are already providing. Keeping documented records of your attempts to reconcile with your wife and financial contributions towards your son's education and other expenses might help you in your case for custody of the child. Further, a family law attorney can guide you through the process of filing for custody and securing visitation rights.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you believe you've been cheated by the CCTV engineer, there are several steps you can take to try to recover your money and hold him accountable. First, gather all evidence, including UPI transaction details, WhatsApp chat records, and any other communication or receipts related to the transaction. This documentation will be crucial for any legal or formal proceedings.Try reaching him through other means, such as email or social media, or ask mutual contacts for assistance. Contact your UPI payment service provider to report the transaction and explain the situation, as they may have procedures to address fraudulent transactions or disputes. Visit your local police station and file a formal complaint, providing all the evidence you have.The police can investigate the matter and take action against the individual. File a complaint with consumer protection agencies or forums, which can mediate disputes between consumers and service providers and help in resolving the issue. If other steps do not yield results, consider consulting a lawyer to explore legal action, such as filing a case in small claims court. Taking these steps promptly can increase your chances of recovering your money and preventing further issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 11 months ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Child custody for a father",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the age of your son, courts generally prefer to keep children, especially young ones, with their mother, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. However, as the father, you have the right to seek custody and visitation. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in custody cases. For visitation rights, you can file a petition for interim relief to ensure regular visitation rights. Given the close proximity of your homes, the court might grant you regular visitation or even shared custody, where your son can spend time with both parents. The court can also grant you overnight stays or weekend visits, depending on the specific circumstances and the child's best interests. As far as the maintenance of your wife and child is concerned, under Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC), your wife can claim maintenance if she is unable to maintain herself. However, you may argue that she has voluntarily left the matrimonial home without sufficient reason and that you have made multiple efforts to reconcile and bring her back. This could influence the court's decision on granting maintenance. As a father, you are legally obligated to provide for your child's education and general well-being. This includes financial support, which you are already providing. Keeping documented records of your attempts to reconcile with your wife and financial contributions towards your son's education and other expenses might help you in your case for custody of the child. Further, a family law attorney can guide you through the process of filing for custody and securing visitation rights.

    "question": "Child custody for a father",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the age of your son, courts generally prefer to keep children, especially young ones, with their mother, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. However, as the father, you have the right to seek custody and visitation. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in custody cases. For visitation rights, you can file a petition for interim relief to ensure regular visitation rights. Given the close proximity of your homes, the court might grant you regular visitation or even shared custody, where your son can spend time with both parents. The court can also grant you overnight stays or weekend visits, depending on the specific circumstances and the child's best interests. As far as the maintenance of your wife and child is concerned, under Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC), your wife can claim maintenance if she is unable to maintain herself. However, you may argue that she has voluntarily left the matrimonial home without sufficient reason and that you have made multiple efforts to reconcile and bring her back. This could influence the court's decision on granting maintenance. As a father, you are legally obligated to provide for your child's education and general well-being. This includes financial support, which you are already providing. Keeping documented records of your attempts to reconcile with your wife and financial contributions towards your son's education and other expenses might help you in your case for custody of the child. Further, a family law attorney can guide you through the process of filing for custody and securing visitation rights.

    "answer": "Dear Client,This basically means that the parties do not have to retire all cases and incur the expenses of depositing assets before approaching the courts for amutual consent divorce. The procedure for filing amutual consent divorceusually entails completing a petition where both spouses agree on aspects such as property division and child issues, including custody, among others. It should be filed alongside the divorce cases or soon afterward, especially when amutual consent divorcehas been tendered on the first occasion, to make sure that both parties respect the agreed-upon timelines.In amutual consent divorce, if you give up property and dismiss claims prior to the process being completed, he may infringe on the MOU. To be safe from this, you should ensure the MOU is very specific, professionally written and/or advised, and then signed. It should also incorporate clauses that safeguard you, as provided below. For instance, you can provide that the transfer of assets and the withdrawal of the cases will only be to them after the first motion is granted, provided that all the actions are done simultaneously and in a legally documented way.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

For a 10-year lease you won’t require any automatic renewal clause. However, for a 11-month sublease creating an 11-month lease with an automatic renewal clause can simplify the process. Using a Power of Attorney (POA) is another method to manage your property while you are abroad. You can execute a POA in favor of your wife/relative, granting them the authority to manage and lease the property on your behalf. If you are in the United States, the POA should be notarized in the US and then attested by the Indian Consulate or Embassy. As far as tax implication is concerned if you lease your property to your wife/relative, they will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income they receive from subtenants.

    "question": "What are tax implications of selling a property in daughter and son in law name to parents of the daughter in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When selling property to parents in Mumbai, it's important to consider tax implications and benefits under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. Section 54 allows individuals to claim capital gains tax exemptions if they reinvest the proceeds in another residential property within a specified period. However, such benefits typically do not apply when selling to family members like parents. Therefore, while the parents can buy the property from their daughter and son-in-law, they would not qualify for Section 54 benefits on capital gains tax exemptions.Additionally, regarding stamp duty, Maharashtra may offer concessions for property transfers to immediate family members. It's advisable to verify the specific stamp duty rates and any available concessions with the local Sub-Registrar's office to understand the financial implications of the transaction fully. This approach ensures compliance with tax laws and helps manage costs effectively when transferring property within the family.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I 10-year lease my property to wife/relative & they can rent for 11 months to other tenants?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You can indeed lease your property to your wife or relative for a long-term 10-year period and allow them to sublease it to tenants for shorter 11 months periods. For a 10-year lease you won’t require any automatic renewal clause. However, for a 11-month sublease creating an 11-month lease with an automatic renewal clause can simplify the process. Using a Power of Attorney (POA) is another method to manage your property while you are abroad. You can execute a POA in favor of your wife/relative, granting them the authority to manage and lease the property on your behalf. If you are in the United States, the POA should be notarized in the US and then attested by the Indian Consulate or Embassy. As far as tax implication is concerned if you lease your property to your wife/relative, they will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income they receive from subtenants. However, if you use a POA, you will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income collected by the POA holder on your behalf.

Generally, the case should be filed where the cause of action arose, which in this instance is Chennai, Tamil Nadu, where your father died in the hospital. Therefore, the appropriate forum would be the court in Chennai, not Hyderabad, even though you reside there for educational purposes.For a claim of Rs 3 crore, the case would fall under the jurisdiction of a higher court. In Tamil Nadu, you would typically approach either the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the relevant High Court, depending on the specifics of the case and the legal advice you receive.It's advisable to consult with a legal expert who can guide you on the correct jurisdiction and procedural aspects of filing a medical negligence case of this magnitude.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant.

The pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Commission is determined by the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, not the compensation claimed. Since the hospital bill (the value of the services paid as consideration) is ₹26 lakhs, it falls within the jurisdiction of the District Consumer Forum, which handles cases where the value does not exceed ₹1 crore.

    "answer": "Dear Client,This basically means that the parties do not have to retire all cases and incur the expenses of depositing assets before approaching the courts for amutual consent divorce. The procedure for filing amutual consent divorceusually entails completing a petition where both spouses agree on aspects such as property division and child issues, including custody, among others. It should be filed alongside the divorce cases or soon afterward, especially when amutual consent divorcehas been tendered on the first occasion, to make sure that both parties respect the agreed-upon timelines.In amutual consent divorce, if you give up property and dismiss claims prior to the process being completed, he may infringe on the MOU. To be safe from this, you should ensure the MOU is very specific, professionally written and/or advised, and then signed. It should also incorporate clauses that safeguard you, as provided below. For instance, you can provide that the transfer of assets and the withdrawal of the cases will only be to them after the first motion is granted, provided that all the actions are done simultaneously and in a legally documented way.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dearclient,Yes you can challenge in the High court under section 482 ofcode of criminal procedurethere is some grounds to be quashed chargesheet :When there is no merit in the FIR as filed against the accused or when allegations do not establish commission of an offence.When the court is of the view that it contains false accusations against the accused.When a compromise was reached between the parties only in exceptional cases.Inconsistency and Suppression:The fact that the original complaint was withheld and a revised version was used for the FIR can serve as a basis to argue that the FIR is baseless, vindictive, or filed with an ulterior motive.Abuse of Process:You can contend that the legal process has been misused by submitting a modified complaint while suppressing the original.Lack of Prima Facie Case:If the elements required for the offenses underSection 498Aand 120B read with 34 IPC are not evident in the modified complaint, you can argue that there is no prima facie case against you.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife's FIR on 498A filed with 2 police complaints the latest one with 498a ingredients and the old one without 498A ingredients",
    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation. This point can highlight police misconduct and procedural lapses, strengthening your case for quashing the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What if husband breaches MOU agreement in mutual consent",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This basically means that the parties do not have to retire all cases and incur the expenses of depositing assets before approaching the courts for amutual consent divorce. The procedure for filing amutual consent divorceusually entails completing a petition where both spouses agree on aspects such as property division and child issues, including custody, among others. It should be filed alongside the divorce cases or soon afterward, especially when amutual consent divorcehas been tendered on the first occasion, to make sure that both parties respect the agreed-upon timelines.In amutual consent divorce, if you give up property and dismiss claims prior to the process being completed, he may infringe on the MOU. To be safe from this, you should ensure the MOU is very specific, professionally written and/or advised, and then signed. It should also incorporate clauses that safeguard you, as provided below. For instance, you can provide that the transfer of assets and the withdrawal of the cases will only be to them after the first motion is granted, provided that all the actions are done simultaneously and in a legally documented way.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can indeed lease your property to your wife or relative for a long-term 10-year period and allow them to sublease it to tenants for shorter 11 months periods. For a 10-year lease you won’t require any automatic renewal clause. However, for a 11-month sublease creating an 11-month lease with an automatic renewal clause can simplify the process. Using a Power of Attorney (POA) is another method to manage your property while you are abroad. You can execute a POA in favor of your wife/relative, granting them the authority to manage and lease the property on your behalf. If you are in the United States, the POA should be notarized in the US and then attested by the Indian Consulate or Embassy. As far as tax implication is concerned if you lease your property to your wife/relative, they will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income they receive from subtenants. However, if you use a POA, you will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income collected by the POA holder on your behalf.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If your wife insists on living separately and you want to maintain the marriage, applying forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) might be a viable option. An RCR petition requests the court to direct your spouse to live with you and fulfill marital duties. The RCR process can take several months to over a year to dispose of, depending on the court's schedule and the complexity of the case.If the RCR petition is in your favor and your wife still refuses to return, you can file for divorce after one year of the RCR decree. The divorce process itself can take an additional six months to a few years, depending on whether it's contested or mutual and the court's backlog. Therefore, if you choose to pursue RCR followed by divorce, the entire process could extend over several years.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What if husband breaches MOU agreement in mutual consent",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This basically means that the parties do not have to retire all cases and incur the expenses of depositing assets before approaching the courts for amutual consent divorce. The procedure for filing amutual consent divorceusually entails completing a petition where both spouses agree on aspects such as property division and child issues, including custody, among others. It should be filed alongside the divorce cases or soon afterward, especially when amutual consent divorcehas been tendered on the first occasion, to make sure that both parties respect the agreed-upon timelines.In amutual consent divorce, if you give up property and dismiss claims prior to the process being completed, he may infringe on the MOU. To be safe from this, you should ensure the MOU is very specific, professionally written and/or advised, and then signed. It should also incorporate clauses that safeguard you, as provided below. For instance, you can provide that the transfer of assets and the withdrawal of the cases will only be to them after the first motion is granted, provided that all the actions are done simultaneously and in a legally documented way.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can indeed lease your property to your wife or relative for a long-term 10-year period and allow them to sublease it to tenants for shorter 11 months periods. For a 10-year lease you won’t require any automatic renewal clause. However, for a 11-month sublease creating an 11-month lease with an automatic renewal clause can simplify the process. Using a Power of Attorney (POA) is another method to manage your property while you are abroad. You can execute a POA in favor of your wife/relative, granting them the authority to manage and lease the property on your behalf. If you are in the United States, the POA should be notarized in the US and then attested by the Indian Consulate or Embassy. As far as tax implication is concerned if you lease your property to your wife/relative, they will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income they receive from subtenants. However, if you use a POA, you will be responsible for paying taxes on the rental income collected by the POA holder on your behalf.

Therefore, if you choose to pursue RCR followed by divorce, the entire process could extend over several years.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Banks typically have procedures for such situations and might allow you to retrieve your belongings under supervision. If the bank does not cooperate, you may need to seek a court order. For that, serve a legal notice to the bank through a lawyer, demanding the return of your belongings. If the bank does not respond to the legal notice, file a civil suit seeking an interim order from the court for the immediate retrieval of your personal belongings. It is advisable to hire a lawyer for representation of your case.

    "question": "Adoption of child",
    "answer": "Adoption is not permitted in the personal laws of Muslims in India, and hence they usually go for guardianship of a child through the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.In short,Islam does not recognize adoption. Muslim couple can adopt a child from another muslim couples who must be the natural parents of the child to be given under adoption. If muslim couple wants to adopt a child from an orphanage, then Islam does not permit to do soAdoption is a subject matter of personal law since it is a legal affiliation of a child. Similar to Muslims and Parsis,Christians also can adopt a child from an orphanage with the permission of the concerned court under the Guardian and Ward Act, 1980. Under the Act, a Christian can only take a child for foster care.In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that any person can adopt a child under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 irrespective of religion he or she follows and even if the personal laws of the particular religion does not permitThe JJ Act 2000 is a secular law enabling any person, irrespective of the religion he professes, to take a child in adoption. It is akin to theSpecial Marriage Act1954, which enables any person living in India to get married under that Act, irrespective of the religion he follows. Personal beliefs and faiths, though must be honoured, cannot dictate the operation of the provisions of an enabling statute,Till now Muslims, Christians, Jews and those from the Parsi community only had the power of guardianship in which one possess only legal right on the child till he or she turns an adult. The biological parents have a right to intervene during that period.Therefore you can consult an experienced lawyer in Pune and proceed with the proposed adoption asthe provisions of  JJ actT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Adoption of child",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. The process for adoption in India involves filing a petition in the court where the adoptive parents reside. An Adoption Deed is a legal document that can be drafted to formalize the adoption, but it must be approved by the court to be legally binding.2. Since you live in the UAE and the biological father is in Pune, you may need to coordinate with an advocate in Pune to handle the legal proceedings. Both biological and adoptive parents must provide consent for the adoption.3. The adoption process duration can vary, but it typically takes several months. The court will review the case to ensure that the adoption is in the best interest of the child.4. To find an advocate in Pune, you can search online legal directories or seek recommendations from legal associations. Look for an advocate experienced in family law and adoption cases.5. The religious difference may complicate the process, but since you have full custody and the biological father agrees, it should be manageable. Ensure the advocate is aware of these details to address any legal nuances.6. An Adoption Deed, once legally recognized, can help in updating your son's passport to include his stepfather's name. The deed should be presented to the passport authorities along with the necessary court orders and documents.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Separation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given your situation, you can consider filing for divorce on grounds of cruelty, which includes mental and emotional abuse, and the consistent threats and false accusations by your wife. Document all instances of her abusive behavior and threats, as well as any efforts you made to reconcile or seek counseling. This evidence will support your case in court. Since marital rape is a serious accusation, be prepared to provide evidence or witnesses that can refute her claims.Regarding joint custody of your children, you can file a petition for joint custody during the divorce proceedings. Courts generally consider the best interests of the children when determining custody arrangements. Highlight your active role in their upbringing and your capability to provide for their welfare despite your financial difficulties. The court will evaluate both parents' ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment.

Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant.

    "question": "Illegal transfer of car ownership",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Transfer Without Signature of All Legal Heirs: Generally, the transfer of a deceased person’s vehicle should not be affected without the consent and signatures of all legal heirs, unless there was a valid will or nomination stating otherwise. If no nominee was assigned and no will exists, all legal heirs are required to agree to the transfer. The fact that the car has been transferred without your consent suggests possible fraudulent activity.2. Obtaining Transfer Records: To challenge the illegal transfer and gather evidence, you should file an RTI (Right to Information) application to the Panchkula RTO. This application should request details of the transfer, including the application form, supporting documents, and signatures involved in the transfer process. Additionally, lodge a formal complaint with the Panchkula RTO, detailing the unauthorised transfer and requesting an investigation into the matter.3. Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in the appropriate court challenging the transfer and seeking the return of the car to its legal heirs. The court can issue an injunction to prevent further use or transfer of the vehicle until the matter is resolved. This legal route helps to establish the rightful ownership of the vehicle among all legal heirs.4. Criminal Action: Considering the potential fraud, you can also file a criminal complaint with the local police or magistrate against your elder brother and his daughter. The complaint should allege forgery, fraud, and illegal transfer of property. Provide evidence of the previous fraudulent activities related to your younger brother’s belongings to strengthen your case. By following these steps, you can take appropriate legal action to address the unauthorised transfer and seek justice for the rightful legal heirs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The FIR should detail the fraudulent transfer, missing RTO file, and false accusations against your friend's son.Investigation Process:Document Verification:The police will investigate by verifying the transfer documents, signatures, and any other paperwork involved in the car's transfer.RTO Records:Even if the physical file is missing, the RTO should have digital records or backups that can be retrieved to verify the authenticity of the transfer.Witness Statements:The police will take statements from all involved parties, including your friend, the elder brother, his daughter, and the RTO officials. The police might also question your friend's son to verify the allegations made by the elder brother.Charges of Fraud (Section 420IPC):If the police find evidence that the car was transferred fraudulently without the consent of all legal heirs, criminal charges of fraud can be filed against the elder brother and his daughter.Forgery (Section 468 IPC):If there was any forgery of signatures or documents, charges under Section 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) can be added.Criminal Breach of Trust (Section 406IPC):Since the elder brother had possession of the car key and papers, charges of criminal breach of trust may also be relevant.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is legally possible to pursue two cases in two different courts at the same time. The suit filed against you in November 2023 for the recovery of the amount of money is a suit of financial claim, whereas the possible shift of forum to the Consumer Forum at the NCDRC level would be for relief for mental harassment and a money claim for the denial of the tenant's entry. These are two different problems that can be solved at once in separate courts.Step 1: Acquiring redress through the consumer forum requires making your argument for mental harassment for tenant entry denial and the resulting harm. If you wish, based on the circumstances obtained and receiving cooperation from the magistrate’s office, you may contact the Consumer Forum to seek help and request a faster processing of this case since the magistrate is involved and there are continuous losses arising from the vacant property.Step 2: It may also be appropriate to institute a new claim or apply for an injunction order under Section CrPC 200 to compel the magistrate to launch an investigation and make a tenant entry order expeditiously. By adopting this strategy, you will also avoid more regrets like the current one involving the loss of more money on the dilapidated building and hasten the process of getting justice for your claims.It is best to seek advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable about property and consumer laws so they can give advice that would reflect details regarding the case so that the appropriate legal measures to safeguard the rights of the consumers can be implemented during the said process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In my view what the builder or maintenance company or whosoever is in charge, wants, is the maintenance charges for maintenance of the club house, regardless of the fact that the same is used by the flat purchasers or notIf above is the case then the flat buyers would be bound by their respective agreements/contracts with the builder,  so far the club house is concernedSo take for example,  there is a swimming pool. Not all use it. But still it is required to be maintained. So a flat buyer cannot be heard to say, that,  look, I don't use the pool,  so I won't pay for it. Another example would be the lift.If the builder is preventing the flat owners from letting their flats on rent to tenants and denying access to tenants then that is certainly illegal. Once the flat is allotted on ownership basis or in your case on 90 years exclusive lease basis, then absent any Condition in the contract,  between the builder and flat buyer, the builder cannot stop the flat owners' tenants from entering the premisesSo the affected flat owners can certainly approach the consumer forum.The ongoing case for recovery that is filed by the builder,  would have no bearing on the above case that would be filed by the flat owners with the Consumer forum.As regards the hierarchy of consumer forum, the case has to be filed with the District Commission.A Magistrate court does not have the power to enforce payment of damages by the builder for the losses sustained by  the flat owners due to the builder's denial of access to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Document all instances of her abusive behavior and threats, as well as any efforts you made to reconcile or seek counseling. This evidence will support your case in court. Since marital rape is a serious accusation, be prepared to provide evidence or witnesses that can refute her claims.Regarding joint custody of your children, you can file a petition for joint custody during the divorce proceedings. Courts generally consider the best interests of the children when determining custody arrangements. Highlight your active role in their upbringing and your capability to provide for their welfare despite your financial difficulties. The court will evaluate both parents' ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment.

    "question": "Illegal transfer of car ownership",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Transfer Without Signature of All Legal Heirs: Generally, the transfer of a deceased person’s vehicle should not be affected without the consent and signatures of all legal heirs, unless there was a valid will or nomination stating otherwise. If no nominee was assigned and no will exists, all legal heirs are required to agree to the transfer. The fact that the car has been transferred without your consent suggests possible fraudulent activity.2. Obtaining Transfer Records: To challenge the illegal transfer and gather evidence, you should file an RTI (Right to Information) application to the Panchkula RTO. This application should request details of the transfer, including the application form, supporting documents, and signatures involved in the transfer process. Additionally, lodge a formal complaint with the Panchkula RTO, detailing the unauthorised transfer and requesting an investigation into the matter.3. Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in the appropriate court challenging the transfer and seeking the return of the car to its legal heirs. The court can issue an injunction to prevent further use or transfer of the vehicle until the matter is resolved. This legal route helps to establish the rightful ownership of the vehicle among all legal heirs.4. Criminal Action: Considering the potential fraud, you can also file a criminal complaint with the local police or magistrate against your elder brother and his daughter. The complaint should allege forgery, fraud, and illegal transfer of property. Provide evidence of the previous fraudulent activities related to your younger brother’s belongings to strengthen your case. By following these steps, you can take appropriate legal action to address the unauthorised transfer and seek justice for the rightful legal heirs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Since the SDM has assured that the car will be blacklisted, this prevents the car from being sold or transferred further. However, to initiate criminal proceedings, further action is needed.Your friend should formally request the SDM to write a letter to the police department, asking them to investigate the alleged fraud. This letter will be crucial in initiating a police investigation.Once the SDM writes to the police, your friend can file an FIR (First Information Report) at the local police station. The FIR should detail the fraudulent transfer, missing RTO file, and false accusations against your friend's son.Investigation Process:Document Verification:The police will investigate by verifying the transfer documents, signatures, and any other paperwork involved in the car's transfer.RTO Records:Even if the physical file is missing, the RTO should have digital records or backups that can be retrieved to verify the authenticity of the transfer.Witness Statements:The police will take statements from all involved parties, including your friend, the elder brother, his daughter, and the RTO officials. The police might also question your friend's son to verify the allegations made by the elder brother.Charges of Fraud (Section 420IPC):If the police find evidence that the car was transferred fraudulently without the consent of all legal heirs, criminal charges of fraud can be filed against the elder brother and his daughter.Forgery (Section 468 IPC):If there was any forgery of signatures or documents, charges under Section 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) can be added.Criminal Breach of Trust (Section 406IPC):Since the elder brother had possession of the car key and papers, charges of criminal breach of trust may also be relevant.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What are tax implications of selling a property in daughter and son in law name to parents of the daughter in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When selling property to parents in Mumbai, it's important to consider tax implications and benefits under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. Section 54 allows individuals to claim capital gains tax exemptions if they reinvest the proceeds in another residential property within a specified period. However, such benefits typically do not apply when selling to family members like parents. Therefore, while the parents can buy the property from their daughter and son-in-law, they would not qualify for Section 54 benefits on capital gains tax exemptions.Additionally, regarding stamp duty, Maharashtra may offer concessions for property transfers to immediate family members. It's advisable to verify the specific stamp duty rates and any available concessions with the local Sub-Registrar's office to understand the financial implications of the transaction fully. This approach ensures compliance with tax laws and helps manage costs effectively when transferring property within the family.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Provide them with copies of any related papers and materials, including the previous communication and decisions made.Police Involvement: In case of further aggravation, then visit the local police station with a complaint along with Documentary evidence along the directives of the District Magistrtate’s office and the show cause notice issued under Disaster Management Act. Defend the FIR by having the proof for harassment and denial of access.Model Tenancy Act: To ensure tenure security of tenants, avail the provisions of the Model Tenancy Act, implemented by UP. Home; Ontario Provincial Complaints; Provincial Complaints Ontario; File a complaint with the Rent Authority of the Deputy Collector citing the specific problem and demanding action to protect the rights of tenants without excessive harassment.Public Grievance Portal: If necessary, appeal the matter through the Chief Minister, Office or through the Public Grievance Portal again.

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is legally possible to pursue two cases in two different courts at the same time. The suit filed against you in November 2023 for the recovery of the amount of money is a suit of financial claim, whereas the possible shift of forum to the Consumer Forum at the NCDRC level would be for relief for mental harassment and a money claim for the denial of the tenant's entry. These are two different problems that can be solved at once in separate courts.Step 1: Acquiring redress through the consumer forum requires making your argument for mental harassment for tenant entry denial and the resulting harm. If you wish, based on the circumstances obtained and receiving cooperation from the magistrate’s office, you may contact the Consumer Forum to seek help and request a faster processing of this case since the magistrate is involved and there are continuous losses arising from the vacant property.Step 2: It may also be appropriate to institute a new claim or apply for an injunction order under Section CrPC 200 to compel the magistrate to launch an investigation and make a tenant entry order expeditiously. By adopting this strategy, you will also avoid more regrets like the current one involving the loss of more money on the dilapidated building and hasten the process of getting justice for your claims.It is best to seek advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable about property and consumer laws so they can give advice that would reflect details regarding the case so that the appropriate legal measures to safeguard the rights of the consumers can be implemented during the said process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In my view what the builder or maintenance company or whosoever is in charge, wants, is the maintenance charges for maintenance of the club house, regardless of the fact that the same is used by the flat purchasers or notIf above is the case then the flat buyers would be bound by their respective agreements/contracts with the builder,  so far the club house is concernedSo take for example,  there is a swimming pool. Not all use it. But still it is required to be maintained. So a flat buyer cannot be heard to say, that,  look, I don't use the pool,  so I won't pay for it. Another example would be the lift.If the builder is preventing the flat owners from letting their flats on rent to tenants and denying access to tenants then that is certainly illegal. Once the flat is allotted on ownership basis or in your case on 90 years exclusive lease basis, then absent any Condition in the contract,  between the builder and flat buyer, the builder cannot stop the flat owners' tenants from entering the premisesSo the affected flat owners can certainly approach the consumer forum.The ongoing case for recovery that is filed by the builder,  would have no bearing on the above case that would be filed by the flat owners with the Consumer forum.As regards the hierarchy of consumer forum, the case has to be filed with the District Commission.A Magistrate court does not have the power to enforce payment of damages by the builder for the losses sustained by  the flat owners due to the builder's denial of access to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

The court may also pass an injunction to prevent the daughter from entering into any agreements until further orders. For specific guidance and better representation, it is necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in civil law and property disputes.

Document all instances of her abusive behavior and threats, as well as any efforts you made to reconcile or seek counseling. This evidence will support your case in court. Since marital rape is a serious accusation, be prepared to provide evidence or witnesses that can refute her claims.Regarding joint custody of your children, you can file a petition for joint custody during the divorce proceedings. Courts generally consider the best interests of the children when determining custody arrangements. Highlight your active role in their upbringing and your capability to provide for their welfare despite your financial difficulties. The court will evaluate both parents' ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment.

    "context": "Asked 11 months ago in Civil Law",
    "question": "Illegal transfer of car ownership",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Transfer Without Signature of All Legal Heirs: Generally, the transfer of a deceased person’s vehicle should not be affected without the consent and signatures of all legal heirs, unless there was a valid will or nomination stating otherwise. If no nominee was assigned and no will exists, all legal heirs are required to agree to the transfer. The fact that the car has been transferred without your consent suggests possible fraudulent activity.2. Obtaining Transfer Records: To challenge the illegal transfer and gather evidence, you should file an RTI (Right to Information) application to the Panchkula RTO. This application should request details of the transfer, including the application form, supporting documents, and signatures involved in the transfer process. Additionally, lodge a formal complaint with the Panchkula RTO, detailing the unauthorised transfer and requesting an investigation into the matter.3. Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in the appropriate court challenging the transfer and seeking the return of the car to its legal heirs. The court can issue an injunction to prevent further use or transfer of the vehicle until the matter is resolved. This legal route helps to establish the rightful ownership of the vehicle among all legal heirs.4. Criminal Action: Considering the potential fraud, you can also file a criminal complaint with the local police or magistrate against your elder brother and his daughter. The complaint should allege forgery, fraud, and illegal transfer of property. Provide evidence of the previous fraudulent activities related to your younger brother’s belongings to strengthen your case. By following these steps, you can take appropriate legal action to address the unauthorised transfer and seek justice for the rightful legal heirs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The FIR should detail the fraudulent transfer, missing RTO file, and false accusations against your friend's son.Investigation Process:Document Verification:The police will investigate by verifying the transfer documents, signatures, and any other paperwork involved in the car's transfer.RTO Records:Even if the physical file is missing, the RTO should have digital records or backups that can be retrieved to verify the authenticity of the transfer.Witness Statements:The police will take statements from all involved parties, including your friend, the elder brother, his daughter, and the RTO officials. The police might also question your friend's son to verify the allegations made by the elder brother.Charges of Fraud (Section 420IPC):If the police find evidence that the car was transferred fraudulently without the consent of all legal heirs, criminal charges of fraud can be filed against the elder brother and his daughter.Forgery (Section 468 IPC):If there was any forgery of signatures or documents, charges under Section 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) can be added.Criminal Breach of Trust (Section 406IPC):Since the elder brother had possession of the car key and papers, charges of criminal breach of trust may also be relevant.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It can address unfair trade practices and harassment issues and can offer remedies, including monetary damages.District Magistrate Follow-Up: As you reported your grievance to the District Magistrate, who has forwarded the same to the ADM (Executive), follow up your complaint with the Office of the ADM and insistently enquire about the action taken on their part. Provide them with copies of any related papers and materials, including the previous communication and decisions made.Police Involvement: In case of further aggravation, then visit the local police station with a complaint along with Documentary evidence along the directives of the District Magistrtate’s office and the show cause notice issued under Disaster Management Act.

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is legally possible to pursue two cases in two different courts at the same time. The suit filed against you in November 2023 for the recovery of the amount of money is a suit of financial claim, whereas the possible shift of forum to the Consumer Forum at the NCDRC level would be for relief for mental harassment and a money claim for the denial of the tenant's entry. These are two different problems that can be solved at once in separate courts.Step 1: Acquiring redress through the consumer forum requires making your argument for mental harassment for tenant entry denial and the resulting harm. If you wish, based on the circumstances obtained and receiving cooperation from the magistrate’s office, you may contact the Consumer Forum to seek help and request a faster processing of this case since the magistrate is involved and there are continuous losses arising from the vacant property.Step 2: It may also be appropriate to institute a new claim or apply for an injunction order under Section CrPC 200 to compel the magistrate to launch an investigation and make a tenant entry order expeditiously. By adopting this strategy, you will also avoid more regrets like the current one involving the loss of more money on the dilapidated building and hasten the process of getting justice for your claims.It is best to seek advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable about property and consumer laws so they can give advice that would reflect details regarding the case so that the appropriate legal measures to safeguard the rights of the consumers can be implemented during the said process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In my view what the builder or maintenance company or whosoever is in charge, wants, is the maintenance charges for maintenance of the club house, regardless of the fact that the same is used by the flat purchasers or notIf above is the case then the flat buyers would be bound by their respective agreements/contracts with the builder,  so far the club house is concernedSo take for example,  there is a swimming pool. Not all use it. But still it is required to be maintained. So a flat buyer cannot be heard to say, that,  look, I don't use the pool,  so I won't pay for it. Another example would be the lift.If the builder is preventing the flat owners from letting their flats on rent to tenants and denying access to tenants then that is certainly illegal. Once the flat is allotted on ownership basis or in your case on 90 years exclusive lease basis, then absent any Condition in the contract,  between the builder and flat buyer, the builder cannot stop the flat owners' tenants from entering the premisesSo the affected flat owners can certainly approach the consumer forum.The ongoing case for recovery that is filed by the builder,  would have no bearing on the above case that would be filed by the flat owners with the Consumer forum.As regards the hierarchy of consumer forum, the case has to be filed with the District Commission.A Magistrate court does not have the power to enforce payment of damages by the builder for the losses sustained by  the flat owners due to the builder's denial of access to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "What are tax implications of selling a property in daughter and son in law name to parents of the daughter in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When selling property to parents in Mumbai, it's important to consider tax implications and benefits under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. Section 54 allows individuals to claim capital gains tax exemptions if they reinvest the proceeds in another residential property within a specified period. However, such benefits typically do not apply when selling to family members like parents. Therefore, while the parents can buy the property from their daughter and son-in-law, they would not qualify for Section 54 benefits on capital gains tax exemptions.Additionally, regarding stamp duty, Maharashtra may offer concessions for property transfers to immediate family members. It's advisable to verify the specific stamp duty rates and any available concessions with the local Sub-Registrar's office to understand the financial implications of the transaction fully. This approach ensures compliance with tax laws and helps manage costs effectively when transferring property within the family.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Muslim couple can adopt a child from another muslim couples who must be the natural parents of the child to be given under adoption. If muslim couple wants to adopt a child from an orphanage, then Islam does not permit to do soAdoption is a subject matter of personal law since it is a legal affiliation of a child. Similar to Muslims and Parsis,Christians also can adopt a child from an orphanage with the permission of the concerned court under the Guardian and Ward Act, 1980. Under the Act, a Christian can only take a child for foster care.In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that any person can adopt a child under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 irrespective of religion he or she follows and even if the personal laws of the particular religion does not permitThe JJ Act 2000 is a secular law enabling any person, irrespective of the religion he professes, to take a child in adoption. It is akin to theSpecial Marriage Act1954, which enables any person living in India to get married under that Act, irrespective of the religion he follows. Personal beliefs and faiths, though must be honoured, cannot dictate the operation of the provisions of an enabling statute,Till now Muslims, Christians, Jews and those from the Parsi community only had the power of guardianship in which one possess only legal right on the child till he or she turns an adult. The biological parents have a right to intervene during that period.Therefore you can consult an experienced lawyer in Pune and proceed with the proposed adoption asthe provisions of  JJ actT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Adoption of child",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. The process for adoption in India involves filing a petition in the court where the adoptive parents reside. An Adoption Deed is a legal document that can be drafted to formalize the adoption, but it must be approved by the court to be legally binding.2. Since you live in the UAE and the biological father is in Pune, you may need to coordinate with an advocate in Pune to handle the legal proceedings. Both biological and adoptive parents must provide consent for the adoption.3. The adoption process duration can vary, but it typically takes several months. The court will review the case to ensure that the adoption is in the best interest of the child.4. To find an advocate in Pune, you can search online legal directories or seek recommendations from legal associations. Look for an advocate experienced in family law and adoption cases.5. The religious difference may complicate the process, but since you have full custody and the biological father agrees, it should be manageable. Ensure the advocate is aware of these details to address any legal nuances.6. An Adoption Deed, once legally recognized, can help in updating your son's passport to include his stepfather's name. The deed should be presented to the passport authorities along with the necessary court orders and documents.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What are tax implications of selling a property in daughter and son in law name to parents of the daughter in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When selling property to parents in Mumbai, it's important to consider tax implications and benefits under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. Section 54 allows individuals to claim capital gains tax exemptions if they reinvest the proceeds in another residential property within a specified period. However, such benefits typically do not apply when selling to family members like parents. Therefore, while the parents can buy the property from their daughter and son-in-law, they would not qualify for Section 54 benefits on capital gains tax exemptions.Additionally, regarding stamp duty, Maharashtra may offer concessions for property transfers to immediate family members. It's advisable to verify the specific stamp duty rates and any available concessions with the local Sub-Registrar's office to understand the financial implications of the transaction fully. This approach ensures compliance with tax laws and helps manage costs effectively when transferring property within the family.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your dispute with GIDC over the lease transfer fee is based on the interpretation of the lease transfer policy. You argue that the fee should be calculated from the original 2004 lease date, qualifying for a 5% transfer fee, as the internal financial transactions with Religare Finvest Ltd. and India Resurgent Fund ARC do not constitute a change in ownership. These transactions were for mortgage management and should not affect the lease's tenure.To challenge GIDC's decision, gather all relevant documents, including the original lease agreement and mortgage documents. Highlight that the leaseholder has remained the same since 2004 and submit a formal request to GIDC for a recalculation based on the original lease date. Engage a property lawyer to draft a legal notice if GIDC does not respond favourably. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the relevant regulatory authority.

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is legally possible to pursue two cases in two different courts at the same time. The suit filed against you in November 2023 for the recovery of the amount of money is a suit of financial claim, whereas the possible shift of forum to the Consumer Forum at the NCDRC level would be for relief for mental harassment and a money claim for the denial of the tenant's entry. These are two different problems that can be solved at once in separate courts.Step 1: Acquiring redress through the consumer forum requires making your argument for mental harassment for tenant entry denial and the resulting harm. If you wish, based on the circumstances obtained and receiving cooperation from the magistrate’s office, you may contact the Consumer Forum to seek help and request a faster processing of this case since the magistrate is involved and there are continuous losses arising from the vacant property.Step 2: It may also be appropriate to institute a new claim or apply for an injunction order under Section CrPC 200 to compel the magistrate to launch an investigation and make a tenant entry order expeditiously. By adopting this strategy, you will also avoid more regrets like the current one involving the loss of more money on the dilapidated building and hasten the process of getting justice for your claims.It is best to seek advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable about property and consumer laws so they can give advice that would reflect details regarding the case so that the appropriate legal measures to safeguard the rights of the consumers can be implemented during the said process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In my view what the builder or maintenance company or whosoever is in charge, wants, is the maintenance charges for maintenance of the club house, regardless of the fact that the same is used by the flat purchasers or notIf above is the case then the flat buyers would be bound by their respective agreements/contracts with the builder,  so far the club house is concernedSo take for example,  there is a swimming pool. Not all use it. But still it is required to be maintained. So a flat buyer cannot be heard to say, that,  look, I don't use the pool,  so I won't pay for it. Another example would be the lift.If the builder is preventing the flat owners from letting their flats on rent to tenants and denying access to tenants then that is certainly illegal. Once the flat is allotted on ownership basis or in your case on 90 years exclusive lease basis, then absent any Condition in the contract,  between the builder and flat buyer, the builder cannot stop the flat owners' tenants from entering the premisesSo the affected flat owners can certainly approach the consumer forum.The ongoing case for recovery that is filed by the builder,  would have no bearing on the above case that would be filed by the flat owners with the Consumer forum.As regards the hierarchy of consumer forum, the case has to be filed with the District Commission.A Magistrate court does not have the power to enforce payment of damages by the builder for the losses sustained by  the flat owners due to the builder's denial of access to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the GPA is registered, it will be on record at the local Sub-Registrar's Office where it was registered. The other daughters can apply for a certified copy of the GPA from the Sub-Registrar’s office. If the GPA was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, coercion, or undue influence, the affected parties can file a civil suit seeking the cancellation of the GPA. Along with the civil suit, an application for a stay order can be filed to prevent any further actions under the GPA. This would restrain the powers granted to the daughter by the GPA. The court may also pass an injunction to prevent the daughter from entering into any agreements until further orders.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Consult a legal expert to review the validity of the unregistered contracts and the implications of the ongoing court cases. Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status. This will help in obtaining a title clearance certificate.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is presented effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Provide them with copies of any related papers and materials, including the previous communication and decisions made.Police Involvement: In case of further aggravation, then visit the local police station with a complaint along with Documentary evidence along the directives of the District Magistrtate’s office and the show cause notice issued under Disaster Management Act. Defend the FIR by having the proof for harassment and denial of access.Model Tenancy Act: To ensure tenure security of tenants, avail the provisions of the Model Tenancy Act, implemented by UP.

    "question": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is legally possible to pursue two cases in two different courts at the same time. The suit filed against you in November 2023 for the recovery of the amount of money is a suit of financial claim, whereas the possible shift of forum to the Consumer Forum at the NCDRC level would be for relief for mental harassment and a money claim for the denial of the tenant's entry. These are two different problems that can be solved at once in separate courts.Step 1: Acquiring redress through the consumer forum requires making your argument for mental harassment for tenant entry denial and the resulting harm. If you wish, based on the circumstances obtained and receiving cooperation from the magistrate’s office, you may contact the Consumer Forum to seek help and request a faster processing of this case since the magistrate is involved and there are continuous losses arising from the vacant property.Step 2: It may also be appropriate to institute a new claim or apply for an injunction order under Section CrPC 200 to compel the magistrate to launch an investigation and make a tenant entry order expeditiously. By adopting this strategy, you will also avoid more regrets like the current one involving the loss of more money on the dilapidated building and hasten the process of getting justice for your claims.It is best to seek advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable about property and consumer laws so they can give advice that would reflect details regarding the case so that the appropriate legal measures to safeguard the rights of the consumers can be implemented during the said process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife's FIR on 498A filed with 2 police complaints the latest one with 498a ingredients and the old one without 498A ingredients",
    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation. This point can highlight police misconduct and procedural lapses, strengthening your case for quashing the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the GPA was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, coercion, or undue influence, the affected parties can file a civil suit seeking the cancellation of the GPA. Along with the civil suit, an application for a stay order can be filed to prevent any further actions under the GPA. This would restrain the powers granted to the daughter by the GPA. The court may also pass an injunction to prevent the daughter from entering into any agreements until further orders.

    "question": "Ad Valorem Court Fees in suit for declaration of title and injunction",
    "answer": "in order to find out whether the suit is properly valued or not, one has to look into the averments in the plaint, the relief sought for and then decide the provision which is to be invoked for payment of court fee. In this context, it is also necessary to keep in mind Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.The declaration that a particular sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff would become necessary only when a person who has interest in the property, but is not a signatory to the document, and some other person purports to convey the said title.in other cases, whether the subject matter of the suit is capable of valuation or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher.That is precisely what Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act provides. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. Therefore, only a person who is a party to the instrument is entitled to such relief. Any person against whom the instrument is void/voidable reasonably apprehends that such instrument if left outstanding, it may cause him serious injury, he may bring a suit to get the document annulled. That is precisely what is done by the plaintiff by filing the suit. A clever drafting would not enable the plaintiff to avoid payment of court fee. Instead of seeking possession after cancellation, the relief is sought is by way of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to surrender the schedule property, failing which he would get it through process of court. In other words, after the sale deed is cancelled, the plaintiff wants delivery of possession. Therefore, he ought to have sought for cancellation of the sale deed under Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act, sought for consequential reliefs then the valuation of suit may not be proper.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I agree with your advocate no ad valorem court fee is required to be paid when the plaintiff is not seeking recovery of possession and is already in possession of the suit property. In the case ofTara Devi v. Sri Thakur Radha Krishna Maharaj through Sebaits Chandeshwar Prasad & Meshwar Prasad & Anr.[AIR 1987 SC 2085], the Supreme Court held that \"whenever the suit is for declaration and consequential relief, the value put forward by the plaintiff for the purpose of court fees and for the purpose of suit valuation is to be generally accepted by the court, except where the same is 'demonstratively arbitrary' or 'unreasonable'.” Therefore, in your case, as you are already in settled possession of the property based on the GPA/Will/ATS transaction, the court fees paid for the injunction and declaration reliefs should be sufficient. In order to address the court order, you can draft an application requesting the reconsideration of the court fee order through your lawyer emphasizing that you have been in continuous and settled possession of the property for 32 years and that your suit primarily seeks to confirm your existing rights rather than recover possession.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Kindly review the agreement thoroughly to understand the provisions regarding refund of the paid amount in case of the builder's failure to fulfil their obligations. Send a written notice to the builder demanding a full refund of the amount you have paid (₹3 lakhs + stamp duty). mention the breach of contract and the builder's failure to fulfil their obligations as the grounds for the refund request. If the builder refuses to refund the amount, you can consider filing a consumer complaint before the appropriate consumer forum.

    "question": "Ad Valorem Court Fees in suit for declaration of title and injunction",
    "answer": "in order to find out whether the suit is properly valued or not, one has to look into the averments in the plaint, the relief sought for and then decide the provision which is to be invoked for payment of court fee. In this context, it is also necessary to keep in mind Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.The declaration that a particular sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff would become necessary only when a person who has interest in the property, but is not a signatory to the document, and some other person purports to convey the said title.in other cases, whether the subject matter of the suit is capable of valuation or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher.That is precisely what Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act provides. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. Therefore, only a person who is a party to the instrument is entitled to such relief. Any person against whom the instrument is void/voidable reasonably apprehends that such instrument if left outstanding, it may cause him serious injury, he may bring a suit to get the document annulled. That is precisely what is done by the plaintiff by filing the suit. A clever drafting would not enable the plaintiff to avoid payment of court fee. Instead of seeking possession after cancellation, the relief is sought is by way of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to surrender the schedule property, failing which he would get it through process of court. In other words, after the sale deed is cancelled, the plaintiff wants delivery of possession. Therefore, he ought to have sought for cancellation of the sale deed under Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act, sought for consequential reliefs then the valuation of suit may not be proper.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The builder's inability to provide the EC certificate before the agreed timeline is a clear breach of the terms of the agreement. Kindly review the agreement thoroughly to understand the provisions regarding refund of the paid amount in case of the builder's failure to fulfil their obligations. Send a written notice to the builder demanding a full refund of the amount you have paid (₹3 lakhs + stamp duty). mention the breach of contract and the builder's failure to fulfil their obligations as the grounds for the refund request. If the builder refuses to refund the amount, you can consider filing a consumer complaint before the appropriate consumer forum. The builder’s pressure to switch to other banks may not be in your best interest as that would further complicate the situation.

    "question": "Section 69 Subsection 1 The Indian Partnership Act 1932",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on Section 69(1) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, your advocate's technical point challenges the jurisdiction and maintainability of the suit filed by your sister. This section stipulates that no suit to enforce a right arising from a contract or conferred by this Act shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of any person suing as a partner in a firm against the firm or any person alleged to be or to have been a partner in the firm unless the firm is registered and the person suing is or has been shown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the firm. Essentially, for a suit to be maintainable, the firm must be registered, and the suing party must be recognised as a partner in the firm's register.Here are some relevant judgements and citations that might support your case:1. Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. vs Ganesh Property (1998) 7 SCC 184: The Supreme Court held that an unregistered firm or its partners cannot enforce a right arising from a contract unless the firm is registered. This judgement reinforces the necessity of firm registration for maintaining such suits.2. S V Chandra Pandian vs S V Sivalinga Nadar (1993) 1 SCC 589: This case emphasised that the bar under Section 69(1) of the Partnership Act applies to suits for enforcement of rights arising from contracts or conferred by the Act.3. Shreeram Finance Corporation vs Yasin Khan (1989) 3 SCC 476: The Supreme Court in this case ruled that an unregistered partnership firm cannot file a suit to enforce contractual rights. This judgement underlines the importance of firm registration in maintaining a suit.In light of these judgments, your advocate's argument based on Section 69(1) appears legally sound. It implies that if your sister is claiming a share in the proprietorship firm using a fabricated MOU and the firm is not registered, or she is not listed as a partner in the firm's register, the suit should not be maintainable.You should present these citations and arguments before the court to contest the jurisdiction and maintainability of the suit effectively. Consulting with your advocate to ensure that these points are adequately argued and substantiated with relevant legal precedents will strengthen your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ad Valorem Court Fees in suit for declaration of title and injunction",
    "answer": "in order to find out whether the suit is properly valued or not, one has to look into the averments in the plaint, the relief sought for and then decide the provision which is to be invoked for payment of court fee. In this context, it is also necessary to keep in mind Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.The declaration that a particular sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff would become necessary only when a person who has interest in the property, but is not a signatory to the document, and some other person purports to convey the said title.in other cases, whether the subject matter of the suit is capable of valuation or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher.That is precisely what Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act provides. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. Therefore, only a person who is a party to the instrument is entitled to such relief. Any person against whom the instrument is void/voidable reasonably apprehends that such instrument if left outstanding, it may cause him serious injury, he may bring a suit to get the document annulled. That is precisely what is done by the plaintiff by filing the suit. A clever drafting would not enable the plaintiff to avoid payment of court fee. Instead of seeking possession after cancellation, the relief is sought is by way of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to surrender the schedule property, failing which he would get it through process of court. In other words, after the sale deed is cancelled, the plaintiff wants delivery of possession. Therefore, he ought to have sought for cancellation of the sale deed under Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act, sought for consequential reliefs then the valuation of suit may not be proper.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

In the case ofTara Devi v.

In order to address the court order, you can draft an application requesting the reconsideration of the court fee order through your lawyer emphasizing that you have been in continuous and settled possession of the property for 32 years and that your suit primarily seeks to confirm your existing rights rather than recover possession.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Section 69 Subsection 1 The Indian Partnership Act 1932",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on Section 69(1) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, your advocate's technical point challenges the jurisdiction and maintainability of the suit filed by your sister. This section stipulates that no suit to enforce a right arising from a contract or conferred by this Act shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of any person suing as a partner in a firm against the firm or any person alleged to be or to have been a partner in the firm unless the firm is registered and the person suing is or has been shown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the firm. Essentially, for a suit to be maintainable, the firm must be registered, and the suing party must be recognised as a partner in the firm's register.Here are some relevant judgements and citations that might support your case:1. Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. vs Ganesh Property (1998) 7 SCC 184: The Supreme Court held that an unregistered firm or its partners cannot enforce a right arising from a contract unless the firm is registered. This judgement reinforces the necessity of firm registration for maintaining such suits.2. S V Chandra Pandian vs S V Sivalinga Nadar (1993) 1 SCC 589: This case emphasised that the bar under Section 69(1) of the Partnership Act applies to suits for enforcement of rights arising from contracts or conferred by the Act.3. Shreeram Finance Corporation vs Yasin Khan (1989) 3 SCC 476: The Supreme Court in this case ruled that an unregistered partnership firm cannot file a suit to enforce contractual rights. This judgement underlines the importance of firm registration in maintaining a suit.In light of these judgments, your advocate's argument based on Section 69(1) appears legally sound. It implies that if your sister is claiming a share in the proprietorship firm using a fabricated MOU and the firm is not registered, or she is not listed as a partner in the firm's register, the suit should not be maintainable.You should present these citations and arguments before the court to contest the jurisdiction and maintainability of the suit effectively. Consulting with your advocate to ensure that these points are adequately argued and substantiated with relevant legal precedents will strengthen your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case of your father gifting his property to you, NOCs from your siblings are generally not required, as the property belongs solely to your father and he has the right to gift it to whomever he chooses. However, it is advisable to check with the specific bank regarding their policies, as some banks might request NOCs from other family members to avoid future disputes, especially when the gifted property is used as collateral for a loan.Regarding the changes for a gift deed in Chhattisgarh, you will need to ensure that the gift deed is properly drafted, stamped, and registered with the appropriate sub-registrar's office. Since the property papers are currently with the bank due to an ongoing loan, you will need to obtain the bank's permission or clearance to proceed with the gift deed. This typically involves settling any outstanding loan amount or obtaining a formal release of the property documents from the bank.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment - private invitation for tender process",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. As a party to the tender, if you felt that the process was fraudulent, then there are several things you can do legally. First, you may approach the Registrar of Cooperative Societies with a complaint focusing on the differences between the tender that was made available to you and the one published. Besides, you can write to the managing committee via a legal notice and demand that they explain why these irregularities exist and come clean over them. Another course of action is to approach the court and seek a legal remedy in the form of bringing an action against the society and the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation. Another thing you can demand is a temporary stop to redeveloping by the court until the problem is solved.2. As for your chosen developers, you can legally do something in this case. One can still add this problem to the list of concerns for the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and point out that the identified tendering process is not transparent and might be biassed. You can also state this matter in the legal notice you served them regarding their failure to invite your recommended developers. Also, you may request a court to extend the tender process to the developers you recommended, particularly if you can prove the unfairness of the selection process.3. Tenders often come with specific written specifications, and where the tender has stipulated specific amenities and can legally offer them or there is no legal bar to the builder offering them, then legal obligations compel the builder to offer these amenities. In this situation, if the builder is reluctant to provide these amenities, you may approach the Consumer Forum by stating that the builder has committed a deficiency in service. You may also sue to have the terms of the tender complied with or apply to the court for a specific performance order to compel the builder to tender in accordance with the set-down requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Society transfer charges for gift deed (husband to wife)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As you have made a registered Gift Deed to transfer 50% rights of your flat to your wife’s self, you should not be liable to pay transfer fees under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act. As per By-law No. 38, transfer fees cannot go beyond ₹25,000 and many societies cannot demand extra charges as ‘voluntary donations.’ Since the society has received legal opinion stating no objection to the transfer, you may wish to refer to relevant legal provisions that prove that the society’s resolution to charge for transfer fees is unlawful. The third step is to make a formal appeal to the managing committee of the society through a legal notice stating the laws under which you want to get a waiver of the fee. If they do not, you can go through the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the legal avenues available through the Bombay High Court. Collect all documents such as the Gift Deed document, the societies standing rules, and requirements needed for the transfer without charges. In the event that the society makes any unreasonable demands, it is wise to engage an attorney to represent you in the case.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Engagement while going through divorce proceedings",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. That is a good sign, so that the person you wish to get engaged with is informed of the legal cases that have been brought by your current wife. Clearing it up means that the person must know every detail concerning your legal issue for them to be fully aware of the consequences and factors surrounding your case.2.  Pretending to be unmarried when in fact there is a legal marriage is legal in India, as engagement is considered to be a social but not legal affair. But it is important to note that the engagement itself, according to the law, is not prohibited, although certain repercussions could be expected in the course of the ongoing cases. Engagement can legally bind your actions; your current wife could claim that the engagement involved adultery or could use it to bolster her case against you and your family.3.  As you remain legally married, sexual relations can bring up ethical and legal issues in an engagement. All the current cases, especially those that can attract charges such as 498A (cruelty), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous harm), and even those related todomestic violence, could be affected by your involvement. It may also attract unfavourable judgements from courts depending on their stance towards the engagement; hence, it may complicate the resolution of the current disputes.4. It is not that it is wrong that, on this, you have received varying responses for and against the occurrence. However, the law does not ban the two from engaging in an affair while still married, hence the need to exercise a lot of caution. Working with a lawyer who is familiar with the details of your cases can make you wiser regarding legal matters best suited for your practice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment - private invitation for tender process",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. As a party to the tender, if you felt that the process was fraudulent, then there are several things you can do legally. First, you may approach the Registrar of Cooperative Societies with a complaint focusing on the differences between the tender that was made available to you and the one published. Besides, you can write to the managing committee via a legal notice and demand that they explain why these irregularities exist and come clean over them. Another course of action is to approach the court and seek a legal remedy in the form of bringing an action against the society and the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation. Another thing you can demand is a temporary stop to redeveloping by the court until the problem is solved.2. As for your chosen developers, you can legally do something in this case. One can still add this problem to the list of concerns for the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and point out that the identified tendering process is not transparent and might be biassed. You can also state this matter in the legal notice you served them regarding their failure to invite your recommended developers. Also, you may request a court to extend the tender process to the developers you recommended, particularly if you can prove the unfairness of the selection process.3. Tenders often come with specific written specifications, and where the tender has stipulated specific amenities and can legally offer them or there is no legal bar to the builder offering them, then legal obligations compel the builder to offer these amenities. In this situation, if the builder is reluctant to provide these amenities, you may approach the Consumer Forum by stating that the builder has committed a deficiency in service. You may also sue to have the terms of the tender complied with or apply to the court for a specific performance order to compel the builder to tender in accordance with the set-down requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Engagement while going through divorce proceedings",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. That is a good sign, so that the person you wish to get engaged with is informed of the legal cases that have been brought by your current wife. Clearing it up means that the person must know every detail concerning your legal issue for them to be fully aware of the consequences and factors surrounding your case.2.  Pretending to be unmarried when in fact there is a legal marriage is legal in India, as engagement is considered to be a social but not legal affair. But it is important to note that the engagement itself, according to the law, is not prohibited, although certain repercussions could be expected in the course of the ongoing cases. Engagement can legally bind your actions; your current wife could claim that the engagement involved adultery or could use it to bolster her case against you and your family.3.  As you remain legally married, sexual relations can bring up ethical and legal issues in an engagement. All the current cases, especially those that can attract charges such as 498A (cruelty), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous harm), and even those related todomestic violence, could be affected by your involvement. It may also attract unfavourable judgements from courts depending on their stance towards the engagement; hence, it may complicate the resolution of the current disputes.4. It is not that it is wrong that, on this, you have received varying responses for and against the occurrence. However, the law does not ban the two from engaging in an affair while still married, hence the need to exercise a lot of caution. Working with a lawyer who is familiar with the details of your cases can make you wiser regarding legal matters best suited for your practice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Documentation Review: Ensure you collect all the documentation, including the bill entry, receipt of payment for GST, communication with the logistics company, and voicemail from the port authority. Make sure that the adoption plan includes the timeline of events as well as compliance with the following document.2. Legal Notice: Write a legal notice to the logistics company and port authorities, raising awareness about how their duties were not met, which leads to unjust imprisonment and demurrage fees. This means that you can demand a refund of these charges while presenting proof that you conducted the actions as and when expected or that the delays were not your fault.3. Engage Legal Counsel: Act swiftly and seek the legal advice of a maritime or logistics attorney with specific knowledge of port operations and relevant legal conflicts. Convey your timetable, the submitted papers, and the legal notice to them for their consideration. They can advise you on the best legal recourse, and should you require it, they can defend and RT you.4. Formal Complaint: In case the legal notice does not elicit a favourable response from the receiver, seek to escalate the matter by lodging a complaint with the regulatory agencies in charge of ports and logistics service providers, as likely indicated by the Directorate General of Shipping or Customs Authority.5. Mediation or Arbitration: Present the concepts of mediation and/or arbitration as forms of more severe conflict resolution. These tend to be faster and less confrontational than those and proceedings in court.6. Legal Action: In the worst-case scenario, it is advised to launch a lawsuit against the culprit persons for the recovery of the undue detention and demurrage fees based on facts like breach of contract and negligence.This is a very important point that one must always take heed to: make sure that records of all communications and activities are kept well.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Documentation Review: Ensure you collect all the documentation, including the bill entry, receipt of payment for GST, communication with the logistics company, and voicemail from the port authority. Make sure that the adoption plan includes the timeline of events as well as compliance with the following document.2. Legal Notice: Write a legal notice to the logistics company and port authorities, raising awareness about how their duties were not met, which leads to unjust imprisonment and demurrage fees. This means that you can demand a refund of these charges while presenting proof that you conducted the actions as and when expected or that the delays were not your fault.3. Engage Legal Counsel: Act swiftly and seek the legal advice of a maritime or logistics attorney with specific knowledge of port operations and relevant legal conflicts. Convey your timetable, the submitted papers, and the legal notice to them for their consideration. They can advise you on the best legal recourse, and should you require it, they can defend and RT you.4. Formal Complaint: In case the legal notice does not elicit a favourable response from the receiver, seek to escalate the matter by lodging a complaint with the regulatory agencies in charge of ports and logistics service providers, as likely indicated by the Directorate General of Shipping or Customs Authority.5. Mediation or Arbitration: Present the concepts of mediation and/or arbitration as forms of more severe conflict resolution. These tend to be faster and less confrontational than those and proceedings in court.6. Legal Action: In the worst-case scenario, it is advised to launch a lawsuit against the culprit persons for the recovery of the undue detention and demurrage fees based on facts like breach of contract and negligence.This is a very important point that one must always take heed to: make sure that records of all communications and activities are kept well.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Engagement while going through divorce proceedings",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. That is a good sign, so that the person you wish to get engaged with is informed of the legal cases that have been brought by your current wife. Clearing it up means that the person must know every detail concerning your legal issue for them to be fully aware of the consequences and factors surrounding your case.2.  Pretending to be unmarried when in fact there is a legal marriage is legal in India, as engagement is considered to be a social but not legal affair. But it is important to note that the engagement itself, according to the law, is not prohibited, although certain repercussions could be expected in the course of the ongoing cases. Engagement can legally bind your actions; your current wife could claim that the engagement involved adultery or could use it to bolster her case against you and your family.3.  As you remain legally married, sexual relations can bring up ethical and legal issues in an engagement. All the current cases, especially those that can attract charges such as 498A (cruelty), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous harm), and even those related todomestic violence, could be affected by your involvement. It may also attract unfavourable judgements from courts depending on their stance towards the engagement; hence, it may complicate the resolution of the current disputes.4. It is not that it is wrong that, on this, you have received varying responses for and against the occurrence. However, the law does not ban the two from engaging in an affair while still married, hence the need to exercise a lot of caution.

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Yes, depending on the circumstances of the case and your legal advice, you can file an interlocutory application (IA) for the revision of prayer, and the memorandum is filed for leave to amend the prayer. This would be a formal motion to the court to declin the BNS offence, as it is now a valid offence as of July 1. It should also explain the reasons for the proposed amendment and give good justification for why the BNS offence is relevant in this case.2. It is right for your lawyer to worry that such an application may be perceived by the judge as a ploy to drag the process along since IAs are normally filed shortly before a decision is to be made. Nevertheless, if the kinds of change involved in the amendment are important for the case and the cardinal character of the charges imposed, as well as possible outcomes, the risk is justified. The amendment needs to be presented accurately in terms of the urgent need for change and its obvious applicability in the IA discussed; now we can only try to eliminate any foreseeably negative impressions.3. However, as mentioned above, IAs are generally used in civil matters, although they may be utilised in criminal matters under certain circumstances, including new information or developments in the law that can influence the criminal case. The picture is that the amendment can only be given to IA if its need is proved, and justice will be served in this case.4. Yes, it is definitely feasible for there to be another lawyer appearing and arguing the IA when the current lawyer continues to operate in all other matters. This may be a good idea in a situation where the current lawyer seems a bit uneasy or thinks that they are not as persuasive as the other side. However, this should be carried out in a well-coordinated manner in order to ensure that the new lawyer is brought to par with the case facts and the reason for the IA, among other factors with regard to the legal strategies and tactics to be taken.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,To address the detention of the vessel IINS at Nhava Sheva Port and secure a refund for the unwarranted charges, here are the recommended steps:To address the detention of the vessel IINS at Nhava Sheva Port and secure a refund for the unwarranted charges, here are the recommended steps:1. Documentation Review: Ensure you collect all the documentation, including the bill entry, receipt of payment for GST, communication with the logistics company, and voicemail from the port authority. Make sure that the adoption plan includes the timeline of events as well as compliance with the following document.2. Legal Notice: Write a legal notice to the logistics company and port authorities, raising awareness about how their duties were not met, which leads to unjust imprisonment and demurrage fees. This means that you can demand a refund of these charges while presenting proof that you conducted the actions as and when expected or that the delays were not your fault.3. Engage Legal Counsel: Act swiftly and seek the legal advice of a maritime or logistics attorney with specific knowledge of port operations and relevant legal conflicts. Convey your timetable, the submitted papers, and the legal notice to them for their consideration. They can advise you on the best legal recourse, and should you require it, they can defend and RT you.4. Formal Complaint: In case the legal notice does not elicit a favourable response from the receiver, seek to escalate the matter by lodging a complaint with the regulatory agencies in charge of ports and logistics service providers, as likely indicated by the Directorate General of Shipping or Customs Authority.5. Mediation or Arbitration: Present the concepts of mediation and/or arbitration as forms of more severe conflict resolution. These tend to be faster and less confrontational than those and proceedings in court.6. Legal Action: In the worst-case scenario, it is advised to launch a lawsuit against the culprit persons for the recovery of the undue detention and demurrage fees based on facts like breach of contract and negligence.This is a very important point that one must always take heed to: make sure that records of all communications and activities are kept well.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor to understand the potential tax liabilities.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Banks have their own policies and procedures for handling requests to modify loan terms, including the removal of a co-applicant's name. The bank will assess the primary applicant's (your) ability to repay the loan independently before issuing an NOC. There is no specific law that prohibits banks from issuing an NOC for the transfer of property and modification of loan terms in cases like yours. It depends on the bank's terms and conditions. The bank is not mandated by law to remove a co-applicant’s name solely based on the divorce decree. It still depends on the bank's assessment of your ability to service the loan independently. Make sure all required documents are submitted accurately and seek legal assistance to ensure that all procedures are followed correctly.

    "question": "What to do if my lawyer does not cooperate fully?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Yes, depending on the circumstances of the case and your legal advice, you can file an interlocutory application (IA) for the revision of prayer, and the memorandum is filed for leave to amend the prayer. This would be a formal motion to the court to declin the BNS offence, as it is now a valid offence as of July 1. It should also explain the reasons for the proposed amendment and give good justification for why the BNS offence is relevant in this case.2. It is right for your lawyer to worry that such an application may be perceived by the judge as a ploy to drag the process along since IAs are normally filed shortly before a decision is to be made. Nevertheless, if the kinds of change involved in the amendment are important for the case and the cardinal character of the charges imposed, as well as possible outcomes, the risk is justified. The amendment needs to be presented accurately in terms of the urgent need for change and its obvious applicability in the IA discussed; now we can only try to eliminate any foreseeably negative impressions.3. However, as mentioned above, IAs are generally used in civil matters, although they may be utilised in criminal matters under certain circumstances, including new information or developments in the law that can influence the criminal case. The picture is that the amendment can only be given to IA if its need is proved, and justice will be served in this case.4. Yes, it is definitely feasible for there to be another lawyer appearing and arguing the IA when the current lawyer continues to operate in all other matters. This may be a good idea in a situation where the current lawyer seems a bit uneasy or thinks that they are not as persuasive as the other side. However, this should be carried out in a well-coordinated manner in order to ensure that the new lawyer is brought to par with the case facts and the reason for the IA, among other factors with regard to the legal strategies and tactics to be taken.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As per my personal opinion, the Judge will not take cognizance of any offence which is mentioned as an offence in the BNS as it is committed before implementation of BNS and at the point of its commission the said offence was not an offence in the old law i.e., IPC.  [ * The new law will not apply to the offences taking place when IPC is in force]The reason being that is the new laws will apply prospectively and not restropectively.

    "question": "Confused about flagging the file",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When a consumer commission orders the parties to \"inspect the file and flag the same,\" it means that you, as a party to the case, are required to review the case file and mark or highlight the important documents, evidence, and relevant sections that you will rely on during your arguments.Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you understand and comply with this order:Step-by-Step Guide:Visit the Commission Office: Go to the consumer commission office where your case file is maintained.

The file will contain all the documents submitted by both parties, including complaints, responses, evidence, and any previous orders passed by the commission.Review documents: Carefully go through each document in the file. Pay special attention to documents that are crucial to your case, such as:your initial complaint. The response from the opposite party evidence you have submitted (receipts, contracts, correspondences, etc.) any affidavits or witness statements Previous orders or notices from the commission.Flag important documents: Use sticky notes, coloured flags, or any markers provided by the court to highlight important documents or sections within documents. This will help you quickly reference these documents during your argument.Typically, you should flag:documents that support your claims.evidence that disproves the opposite party’s arguments.Key orders or directions were given by the commission in earlier hearings.Take Notes: While reviewing the file, take notes on the documents you have flagged.

Structure them logically, referring to the flagged sections to back up your points.Be concise and clear, focusing on how the evidence supports your claims and counters the opposite party’s arguments.Tips for the hearing:Be Organised: Keep your notes and a copy of your flagged sections handy. Organise them in the order you plan to present them.Be Prepared: Practice your arguments so you can present them confidently and clearly.Be Respectful: Address the commission respectfully and follow any additional instructions given by the court.Additional Assistance:If you feel uncertain about any aspect of this process, you can ask the court staff for guidance.

Alternatively, if you know any legal professionals, they might be able to offer informal advice even if they are not representing you formally.By following these steps, you will be prepared to effectively present your case during the upcoming hearing.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Generally, every school has its own rules and norms on fee charges and T.C. issues. However, here are some points to consider:School Policy: Check the policy of the school or read the agreement signed when enrolling the child. Depending on the terms and conditions of the agreement, it may have clauses related to the fee payment and other terms on which T. C. will be issued.Negotiation: However, there are situations when the policy may be vague or something you consider unfair might be stated in it. There is usually an option to discuss the policy with the management of the school, stating your position and that your son did not attend any classes.Legal Rights: Indian law is quite fair to those who seek education; it requires that educational institutions be reasonable. If you think that the school is violating the law, you might consult an advocate or go to the office of education in your area for assistance.Documentation: Ensure that you maintain any correspondence with the school and/or any other supporting documentation for your request or claim (example: absence of your son during the term).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Father share on the deceased son property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Under Hindu law, a father isn't considered a Class I legal heir when it comes to his deceased son's property. According to the law, only the wife, children, and mother are classified as Class I heirs. However, if Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the patta (title) was transferred to his name alongside the other legal heirs, it suggests that Durai was recognised as a legal heir under specific circumstances. In the event that Durai's share of the property was legally recognised and he signed the lease deed, his portion would indeed become part of Durai's estate upon his death and would be distributed among his legal heirs, such as his wife and children.2. Now, if Durai's share was mistakenly considered his own personal property and distributed based on that assumption, then the release deed stating Poon's share as 1/4 instead of 1/5 would be inaccurate. Poon's actual share should be reassessed as 1/5 of Durai's inherited portion. This means that the release deed could potentially be invalid or require correction in order to accurately reflect the distribution of shares.3. According to Hindu law, a father isn't classified as a Class I legal heir to his deceased son's estate. However, the fact that Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the subsequent actions, such as the transfer of the title and the signing of the lease deed, suggest that the legal procedures might not have strictly adhered to the legal heir classifications. This could be due to administrative or familial arrangements that were in place at that time. Legally speaking, Durai shouldn't have been included as a legal heir, but since he was, the transfer of the title and the lease deed were carried out with his involvement. It would be advisable to seek rectification or legal clarification in order to ensure compliance with theHindu Succession Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Meena can argue on following points:Meena could assert that Durai contributed financially towards acquiring the property in 1987, even if there isn't solid evidence presently available. She might argue on circumstantial evidence like family testimonies or documents indirectly suggesting Durai's involvement.Another point she could emphasize is the inclusion of Durai's name in the legal heir certificate following Ganesh's demise in 1989, indicating acknowledgment of Durai's stake in the property.Additionally, Meena could point out that Ganesh's family didn't oppose the transfer of the property's name in the patta document in 2009, implying recognition of Durai's rightful ownership.She could also argue that Durai's signature on the lease deed for the petrol pump property in 2009 suggests his acknowledged interest in ownership by the family.As for challenging the transfer of the patta name, Meena would need to consider the limitation period based on the relevant jurisdiction's laws, seeking legal counsel for clarification.Regarding the validity of the property sale deed signed by Ganeshan's wife without Ganeshan's mother's signature, this hinges on jurisdictional laws and specific transaction circumstances. Depending on the situation, spousal consent might be required for property transactions, necessitating legal examination of applicable laws.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It enables you to straightaway depone or narrate your side and evidence against top management involving grave offences that were not included in the FIR, such as IPC 467, 420, and 120B offences. The magistrate can issue summons to process the accused in accordance with the law of the complaint.2.Including Offences in the Prayer: Namely, the police will be authorised by the magistrate required by you in your private complaint to include omitted offences under IPC 467, 420, and 120B. You have to prove that, for mens rea purposes, those concerned in the top management of the company were involved in these serious offences, at the very least on the balance of probabilities.3.Requesting ED Investigation:Yes you may also pray in your prayer to the magistrate to direct the enforcement directorate ed, pursuant to the money laundering offences under the PMLA. Offer initial credible substantiation that money laundering offences have been committed so as to warrant an ED investigation to help in the recovery of the proceeds of the crimes.4.Approaching Sessions Court:In general, the section 200 CrPC complaints are lodged with a magistrate from private parties. However, because of the gravity of the mentioned offences (IPC 120B, 467, and the PMLA), you can ask the magistrate to transfer the case to the higher court if necessary, but first, the complaint has to be lodged before a magistrate, who then will decide whether to continue the trial at a lower court or transfer the case to a superior court.These steps can assist in the prevention of serious offences and the involvement of top management in investigations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Agriculture land water well  ownership dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To make the judge aware that you are the absolute owner of the well and have exclusive rights to its use, you should focus on the following steps and legal provisions:1. Documentary Evidence: Whenever appearing in court, ensure that the court is provided with all important documents, such as the land title deed showing that the agricultural land belongs to you, records of previous maintenance, and perhaps any understandings or agreements as to the ownership of the said well.2. Section 7 of the Indian Easements Act: you should focus on Section 7 of the Indian Easements Act. This section of the law deals with the right of the landowner to use and enjoy water sources that are found on land owned by the individual. This section can assist you in developing your rights exclusive from the well since is located on your land.3. Possession and Maintenance Records: this would involve stressing on the periodic and unique usage and practice of the well for the last one and a half decades.

    "answer": "Land Ownership:In India, ownership of land generally extends to anything permanently attached to it, including wells. Since you own the property where the well is located, it's likely that you have the legal right to control its use.Easement Rights:However, there are situations where your neighbor could claim an easement right to the well. This might happen if they have been using the well openly and continuously for a certain period (usually 20 years) without your objection.Local Laws:State-specific laws and local customs might also play a role in determining water rights and usage.Gather Evidence:Collect any documentation that supports your ownership of the well, such as land records, tax receipts, maintenance bills, or any agreements related to the well.Witnesses:If possible, identify witnesses who can testify to your exclusive use and maintenance of the well over the past 12 years.Mediation (Optional):Before escalating the legal battle, you could try mediation as a way to resolve the dispute amicably. A neutral third party can help facilitate a conversation and find a mutually agreeable solutionInjunction:You can seek a court injunction to restrain your neighbor from using the well until the matter is resolved.Declaration:You can file a lawsuit for a declaration from the court confirming your exclusive right to the well.Damages:If you have suffered financial losses due to your neighbor's actions, you may be able to claim compensation.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "question": "BBMP notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If your construction went overboard by an extra 1.5 feet, it can have different consequences. If the extra space was taken from site no. 51 or site no. 49, it means you've encroached on someone else's property. This can lead to legal issues, like potential disputes with the neighbouring property owners and possible penalties imposed by BBMP.2. Yes, BBMP has the authority to order the demolition of any unauthorised construction or encroachment. If it's determined that the additional 1.5 feet were illegally added, BBMP may send you a notice to remove the encroachment. That could involve tearing down the encroached part.3. In such cases, the court usually orders the property to be restored to its original boundaries according to the legal records. If the court finds that there has been an encroachment, it can order you to clear the encroached area and modify or demolish the structure to comply with the legal property boundaries.4. As a precaution, it's a good idea to hire a legal professional who can represent your interests and negotiate with BBMP and the court. Get a detailed survey done on your property to figure out the exact extent of the encroachment. If the encroachment is confirmed, you might have to vacate the encroached portion, which could mean partially tearing down the building.5. It's not clear why site no. 51 didn't check the dimensions when purchasing. It could be due to oversight or not verifying properly. In your case, it was definitely a mistake to not verify the exact dimensions before buying. To avoid such problems in the future, always conduct a thorough survey and verify the property boundaries against official records before finalising any purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Air India, IndiGo, and other notable airlines have been given a show-cause notice by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for violating rules pertaining to providing amenities to passengers in the event of rejected boarding, flight cancellation, and flight delay. The notice emphasises how crucial it is for travellers to understand their legal rights in these circumstances.When an airline declines to carry a passenger who has arrived for boarding within the allotted time, the passenger has the right to know about denied boarding. It is crucial to remember that the airline has the right to prohibit boarding if they have valid reasons, such as concerns about security, health, or safety, or insufficient travel documentation. Overbooking flights by airlines is legal and may lead to rejected boarding. Airlines are required to request volunteers to give up their seats in such situations.The airline is required by DGCA guidelines to provide you with assistance such as meals, lodging, and transportation, as well as compensation and a confirmed seat on a another aircraft if you are forcibly denied boarding.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "If I go for cashless health insurance, hospital says they will not provide hospital bills",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the hospital’s not having bills ready with the authorities for cashless claims, it may be because of organisational internal billing and reimbursement policies of Tamil Nadu government pensioners insurance. This is because they have the flexibility of direct settlement with the insurance provider, although they don’t provide detailed bills for the patients. . Thus, when choosing the option of direct payment, they present bills as part of the essential observance of the procedure that is required if you consider receiving a refund. The actual fact that one has to pay an amount of 3 lakhs in advance shows that normally this coverage pays for 80% of the claim, leaving the actual bill amount to be paid by the patient; however, not providing a bill in a ‘cashless claim’ seems very non-transparent. To determine why such a policy is implemented, it would be more appropriate to press the hospital for answers or contact the insurer if those are the terms of payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If you have evidence of fabrication of a document, misrepresentation of the transaction, or breach of the agreement by the holder of the GPA or the mediator, you can always file another case of forgery or fraud against him.2. In order to know your portion of the land, it is advisable to seek an affirmation through the court of a detailed survey and subsequent partition of the land, which will enable you to understand your proportion of the whole piece of land.3. Indeed, one can still file another case for forgery or fraud against the person with the GPA and the mediator if there is ill intention or misleading information in the sale agreement.4. If you want to gain your share of the land, it is necessary to seek the partition of the properties that have not been divided, whereby the unpartioned property will be divided, and the court will decide which part is yours.5. Where the various parties possess a claim of fraudulent or negligent activity regarding the incurred financial losses, it is possible to seek damages after the civil court case through the GPA and the mediator.6. Yes, you can report the person to the authorities for fraud, especially if the money was taken with the intention of not passing the title deed of the land as agreed. Append to the claim all the correspondences and records of payment that can ever prove the legitimacy of the claim.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Make sure that any new contracts with the developer include strict penalty clauses for future delays and are legally binding.If everything fails, you might want to consider lodging a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (CDRC) to seek compensation for the delay, interest on the amount you paid, and any extra rental costs you've incurred.

    "question": "Complaint of insult the modesty, torture, mental harassment, criminal breach of trust and dowry",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Possible Cases in the FIR: If your wife has filed a complaint, commonplace charges underneath the FIR can also consist ofdomestic violence(Section 498Aof the IPC), dowry harassment, and likely physical assault. The unique sections will depend upon her allegations and the evidence she affords.2. Strength of Your Case: Proof of your final conversation where she expressed a preference to retain the connection can be useful. It can suggest that the allegations of abuse or violence won't align with her previous stance, probably weakening her case.3. Mental Harassment: While'mental harassment' in step with se isn't a standalone offence inside the penal code, it's often taken into consideration beneathdomestic violenceor cruelty (Section 498A). If she accuses you of mental harassment, you need to reveal that no dowry demands have been made. Statements by way of your mother, while not the best,  no longer commonly meet the felony general for harassment unless they were abusive or threatening.4. FIR Quashing: The High Court quashes FIRs in the event that they discover the criticism lacks substance or is frivolous. It appears to be prima facie evidence of abuse of the legal method. Quashing differs from an ordeal in that it prevents useless litigation if the FIR is baseless.5. False Accusations Against Family: If family members are wrongly implicated, they are able to seek to have their names eliminated from the FIR. Post-acquittal or quashing, they are probably able to record a defamation suit against her for fake allegations.6. Stridhan Claims: To deal with the fake claims of Stridhan, accumulate and publish any evidence of her ownership of these gadgets. This may want to encompass pictures, receipts, or written communication indicating that she has them.7. WhatsApp Evidence: If she documented her circle of relatives' court cases about your own family in WhatsApp messages, it may be used as evidence.

    "question": "Complaint of insult the modesty, torture, mental harassment, criminal breach of trust and dowry",
    "answer": "It's important to understand that the specific charges and legal implications can vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction and the details of your situation. However, here's some general information based on your questions:Potential Charges:Domestic Violence(DV):This is a broad term that can include physical, emotional, sexual, or economic abuse. In your case, she may allege physical abuse (which you deny) and mental harassment.Dowry Harassment:If she alleges dowry-related harassment, this could be a separate charge under specific laws in India.Criminal Intimidation:If she claims you threatened her, this could also be a charge.Proof of Willingness to Reconcile:Yes, evidence showing her willingness to reconcile in your last conversation could be helpful to your case. It may demonstrate that her accusations are not consistent with her earlier behavior.You can present text messages, call recordings, emails, or witness testimonies to support this claim.Mental Harassment:While \"mental harassment\" is not a specific crime in theIndian Penal Code(IPC), it can fall under cruelty (Section 498A) in the context ofdomestic violence.You don't need to prove you didn't take dowry unless she specifically accuses you of dowry harassment.If your mother's comments are presented as evidence of mental harassment, you could argue they were not intended to cause distress or that they were made in a private setting.Countering accusations of mental harassment might involve demonstrating your own good behavior, providing evidence of a healthy relationship, or highlighting any inconsistencies in her claims.FIR Quashing:FIR quashing is a legal procedure to get an FIR dismissed before trial. High courts can quash an FIR if it finds the case lacks merit, is frivolous, or is based on false allegations.The process involves filing a petition in the High Court, providing evidence to support your claims, and arguing why the FIR should be quashed.It differs from a normal trial as it focuses on the legality and validity of the FIR itself, rather than determining guilt or innocence.Falsely Implicated Family Members:If the police investigation finds that your family members were wrongly named, their names can be removed from the FIR.It may be difficult to take legal action against your wife for falsely implicating them, but you could consult a lawyer to explore any possible options.Stridhan (Woman's Property):You can provide evidence like photographs, videos, or witness statements to show that she already has her stridhan.You can also ask for a list of items she claims to be missing and try to prove they are already in her possession.WhatsApp Messages as Evidence:WhatsApp messages can be used as evidence in court, but their admissibility depends on factors like their authenticity and relevance to the case.If she admits to fabricating the complaint to extract money, this could be a strong point in your favor. Try to get this admission in writing or recorded, if possible.Mother Filing a DV Complaint:Yes, your mother can potentially file a DV complaint against your wife if she experienceddomestic violencefrom her. This would be a separate legal process.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "1. Transferring Ownership with an Ongoing Home Loan:It is possible to transfer ownership of a property even when a home loan is ongoing. There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor to understand the potential tax liabilities.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

This means it won't function in a separate access manner but can be incorporated into the general land parcel.Given that the purchaser is also purchasing the adjoining belongings, that is, subsequent to the not unusual passage, they need to be capable of amalgamating these types of plots collectively for an unmarried creation.

It loses its separate identity as a \"common passage.\"Buyer's Amalgamation Options:Yes, the buyer can potentially amalgamate all the plots together for a single construction, including the adjacent property they are buying and the formerly common passage.

    "answer": "Dear client,As per  sections 19 and 21 of the POCSO Act, it is mandatory for anyone aware of any instance of child sexual abuse to report it to the Special Juvenile Unit of the police. This report must be documented in writing. The POCSO Act permits anyone, not just the victim or their guardians, to file a complaint. The Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age thereby fixes the age of consent at 18 years. Offence POCSO offenses are generally  non-bailable, meaning that bail is not guaranteed and is subject to the court's discretion. The court will evaluate the gravity of the charges, the evidence provided, and the potential danger to the child before deciding on bail. Effective legal representation can assist in making a case for bail, but it remains difficult due to the severity of the allegations.According to your second question there is chances to get bail on certain grounds The consistent delays by the state police department in filing chargesheets for cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act have led to the release of several accused individuals on bail. Investigating Officers often fail to arrest the accused or file the chargesheet within the mandatory 90-day period, indirectly benefiting the accused and delaying justice.chances of conviction: In a recent ruling, the Delhi High Court highlighted that according to Section 29 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012 (POCSO Act), the presumption of guilt applies only once the prosecution has established the fundamental facts of the case beyond a reasonable doubt.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Ease of filing a POCSO case:In India, anyone can file a POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) complaint if they suspect a child has been sexually abused. In your case, if your wife files a complaint, the police are legally obligated to investigate. However, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.Difficulty in getting bail:In POCSO cases, obtaining bail can be difficult, especially during the initial stages of investigation. The severity of the alleged offense, the risk of the accused fleeing or tampering with evidence, and the potential threat to the child's safety are all considered when deciding bail applications.Chances of conviction against father:The chances of conviction depend heavily on the evidence presented in court. If your wife's accusations are false, you can provide evidence to counter them and prove your innocence.

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "1. Transferring Ownership with an Ongoing Home Loan:It is possible to transfer ownership of a property even when a home loan is ongoing. There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor to understand the potential tax liabilities.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

To prove a defamation case, specific criteria typically need to be satisfied.False Statement: The remark must be untrue. Truth serves as a defense against defamation.Publication: The remark must be communicated to someone other than the person being defamed.Injury: The remark must harm the subject's reputation.Unprivileged: The remark must not be protected by any legal privilege (e.g., in some instances, statements made during legal proceedings are privileged).Although statements made during legal proceedings are typically protected by privilege, false allegations made outside of court may serve as grounds for a defamation claim.

The defamation should be seen from the view of right thinking person.To exercise the rights, one should prove that there was publication of false statement, its impact on his reputation and it should be false and also not in public interest.Under a criminal suit, intention to defame is necessary. The allegation should be made with malice intent to defame another or at least the knowledge that the publication is likely to defame another is essential. It has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act was being done to lower the reputation of another.Statements made about the character of character is not defamation if it is made in order to protect the interests of the person making it, or any other person, or for the public good.Reputation is an asset to each and every one. Any damage to such asset can be legally dealt with. Defamation laws have been enacted to prevent person maliciously using their right to freedom of speech and expression."

    "answer": "Defamation:In India, defamation can be both a civil wrong and a criminal offense. It is defined as making a false statement that harms the reputation of a person. Your wife's statements about your mental health, porn habits, and other untrue allegations could potentially fall under this definition.Proof of Defamation:To establish a defamation case, you need to prove that the statements were:FalsePublished (communicated to a third party)Caused harm to your reputationHusband-Wife Privilege:Your lawyer is likely referring to the legal concept of \"spousal privilege\" or \"marital communication privilege.\" This principle, in some jurisdictions, protects confidential communications between spouses from being used as evidence in court. However, this privilege doesn't apply to communications made in the presence of third parties.Third-Party Disclosure:If your wife made these defamatory statements to other people, it removes the spousal privilege and potentially strengthens your case for defamation.Evidence:Gather evidence to support your claim. This could include:Witness testimonies from people who heard the defamatory statements.Any written or recorded evidence of the statements.Proof that the statements are false (e.g., medical records to refute mental health claims).Civil vs. Criminal Defamation:You can file a civil defamation suit for damages or a criminal defamation complaint, seeking punishment for your wife.

Nowadays, electronic signatures are widely accepted in many countries, including India, thus accepting remote signings of important legal documents, including rental agreements.Here are the steps you can take:1. Use E-Signatures: There is always an option of using an e-signature platform that is valid in India, like Aadhaar e-signature or any other valid e-signature that can be used in India.2.Virtual Signing: Consult with the tenant and/or a local agent to initial the agreement remotely by using video conferencing tools or signing a digital document.3. Legal Advice: I think it is instrumental to seek legal advice prior to drafting the agreement with a view to the applicable laws and regulations in the region.However, it may also be obtained in the form of a power of attorney that authorises someone to sign for or on behalf of a local party, especially if the agreement cannot be signed electronically or remotely.

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Possible Cases in the FIR: If your wife has filed a complaint, commonplace charges underneath the FIR can also consist ofdomestic violence(Section 498Aof the IPC), dowry harassment, and likely physical assault. The unique sections will depend upon her allegations and the evidence she affords.2. Strength of Your Case: Proof of your final conversation where she expressed a preference to retain the connection can be useful. It can suggest that the allegations of abuse or violence won't align with her previous stance, probably weakening her case.3. Mental Harassment: While'mental harassment' in step with se isn't a standalone offence inside the penal code, it's often taken into consideration beneathdomestic violenceor cruelty (Section 498A). If she accuses you of mental harassment, you need to reveal that no dowry demands have been made. Statements by way of your mother, while not the best,  no longer commonly meet the felony general for harassment unless they were abusive or threatening.4. FIR Quashing: The High Court quashes FIRs in the event that they discover the criticism lacks substance or is frivolous. It appears to be prima facie evidence of abuse of the legal method. Quashing differs from an ordeal in that it prevents useless litigation if the FIR is baseless.5. False Accusations Against Family: If family members are wrongly implicated, they are able to seek to have their names eliminated from the FIR. Post-acquittal or quashing, they are probably able to record a defamation suit against her for fake allegations.6. Stridhan Claims: To deal with the fake claims of Stridhan, accumulate and publish any evidence of her ownership of these gadgets. This may want to encompass pictures, receipts, or written communication indicating that she has them.7. WhatsApp Evidence: If she documented her circle of relatives' court cases about your own family in WhatsApp messages, it may be used as evidence. To counter, offer evidence showing a different narrative, inclusive of messages showing goodwill or agreements on different problems.8. Monetary Extraction Admission: If she admits throughout CAW periods that the criticism is to extract cash, record or file this admission. This could be pivotal in discrediting her claims and demonstrating a malafide purpose.9. DV Complaint with the Aid of Mother: Your mom can record a DV complaint against your spouse if she experienced abuse or harassment. This should encompass intellectual or emotional abuse at some point in your spouse’s stay, highlighting that harassment is not one-sided.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It's important to understand that the specific charges and legal implications can vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction and the details of your situation. However, here's some general information based on your questions:Potential Charges:Domestic Violence(DV):This is a broad term that can include physical, emotional, sexual, or economic abuse. In your case, she may allege physical abuse (which you deny) and mental harassment.Dowry Harassment:If she alleges dowry-related harassment, this could be a separate charge under specific laws in India.Criminal Intimidation:If she claims you threatened her, this could also be a charge.Proof of Willingness to Reconcile:Yes, evidence showing her willingness to reconcile in your last conversation could be helpful to your case. It may demonstrate that her accusations are not consistent with her earlier behavior.You can present text messages, call recordings, emails, or witness testimonies to support this claim.Mental Harassment:While \"mental harassment\" is not a specific crime in theIndian Penal Code(IPC), it can fall under cruelty (Section 498A) in the context ofdomestic violence.You don't need to prove you didn't take dowry unless she specifically accuses you of dowry harassment.If your mother's comments are presented as evidence of mental harassment, you could argue they were not intended to cause distress or that they were made in a private setting.Countering accusations of mental harassment might involve demonstrating your own good behavior, providing evidence of a healthy relationship, or highlighting any inconsistencies in her claims.FIR Quashing:FIR quashing is a legal procedure to get an FIR dismissed before trial. High courts can quash an FIR if it finds the case lacks merit, is frivolous, or is based on false allegations.The process involves filing a petition in the High Court, providing evidence to support your claims, and arguing why the FIR should be quashed.It differs from a normal trial as it focuses on the legality and validity of the FIR itself, rather than determining guilt or innocence.Falsely Implicated Family Members:If the police investigation finds that your family members were wrongly named, their names can be removed from the FIR.It may be difficult to take legal action against your wife for falsely implicating them, but you could consult a lawyer to explore any possible options.Stridhan (Woman's Property):You can provide evidence like photographs, videos, or witness statements to show that she already has her stridhan.You can also ask for a list of items she claims to be missing and try to prove they are already in her possession.WhatsApp Messages as Evidence:WhatsApp messages can be used as evidence in court, but their admissibility depends on factors like their authenticity and relevance to the case.If she admits to fabricating the complaint to extract money, this could be a strong point in your favor. Try to get this admission in writing or recorded, if possible.Mother Filing a DV Complaint:Yes, your mother can potentially file a DV complaint against your wife if she experienceddomestic violencefrom her.

Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications.

The bank will assess the primary applicant's (your) ability to repay the loan independently before issuing an NOC. There is no specific law that prohibits banks from issuing an NOC for the transfer of property and modification of loan terms in cases like yours. It depends on the bank's terms and conditions. The bank is not mandated by law to remove a co-applicant’s name solely based on the divorce decree. It still depends on the bank's assessment of your ability to service the loan independently.

    "question": "Amalgamation of plots and common passage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Once the houses are merged and sold to an unmarried purchaser, the common  passage will generally emerge as part of the merged assets. This means it won't function in a separate access manner but can be incorporated into the general land parcel.Given that the purchaser is also purchasing the adjoining belongings, that is, subsequent to the not unusual passage, they need to be capable of amalgamating these types of plots collectively for an unmarried creation. This amalgamation might create a larger, unified plot, potentially bearing in mind greater extensive production or development and difficulty with neighbourhood zoning legal guidelines and regulations. However, it's far more critical to make certain that every prison method for merging the homes and incorporating the common passage into the brand new plot is correctly documented, which includes any vital updates to the land information and approvals from relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Amalgamation of plots and common passage",
    "answer": "Amalgamation and Common Passage:Once you merge the three plots into a single property, the common passage legally becomes part of that amalgamated property. It loses its separate identity as a \"common passage.\"Buyer's Amalgamation Options:Yes, the buyer can potentially amalgamate all the plots together for a single construction, including the adjacent property they are buying and the formerly common passage. However, this would require:Approval from relevant authorities:They would need to obtain permission from the local municipal or planning authority for the amalgamation and construction. This usually involves submitting building plans and obtaining the necessary permits.Compliance with regulations:The construction must adhere to local building codes, zoning regulations, and any other applicable rules. This might include setbacks, height restrictions, etc.Technical feasibility:The amalgamation should be technically feasible, meaning there should be no legal or structural issues preventing it. For instance, there shouldn't be any easements or rights of way over the common passage that would prevent its incorporation into the new construction.Important Considerations:Clear documentation:Ensure that the sale agreement clearly defines the boundaries of the amalgamated property, including the former common passage. This will avoid any future disputes with the buyer of the adjacent property.Title clarity:It's crucial to have a clear title for all the properties involved in the amalgamation. Any existing encumbrances, mortgages, or legal disputes should be resolved before proceeding.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"
