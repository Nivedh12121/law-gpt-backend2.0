Provide documentation, such as your resignation email, any payment records, or any communication regarding your notice period and payment for unserved days.Escalation: If HR refuses to make the change, escalate the issue to a higher authority within the company, such as the manager or senior HR personnel. Explain that the incorrect exit date is affecting your future employment and could have legal implications.Legal Notice: If the issue remains unresolved, you can send a legal notice through a lawyer. In the notice, ask the company to correct the relieving letter to reflect your actual last working day. The notice should also include a deadline for action, typically 7-14 days.Labor Commissioner: As a last resort, you can file a complaint with the local labor commissioner if the issue is not resolved amicably. The labor commissioner may mediate or intervene to ensure that your relieving letter is corrected in accordance with the actual facts.Legal Basis:As per labor laws, employers are obligated to provide accurate records and documents related to employment.

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client ,The Rights and Claims in Mutual Divorce under the Hindu LawThe Jewellery presented by your family at the time of your marriage is typically treated as Stridhan, so it is the wife's sole property according to Hindu law. This implies that you have the right to keep all the jewellery presented to you by your family, and that your husband cannot claim any of it in divorce under the Hindu Law. The Gifts that you receive from your in-laws are also generally considered to be Stridhan and they all also solely belong to you. You can retain such gifts unless you have specifically given them to your husband or if you are in joint ownership and the same is established. Costly gifts offered during the marriage are generally considered your personal property if they were offered to you, and you can retain those in the division of assets in the divorce.Furniture and Other AssetsAs you do not desire the furniture, you can keep it out of the mutual settlement in divorce. Property division largely hinges on contribution and ownership. If the furniture is jointly held or in the name of your husband, you can opt out of claiming it.Financial Claims and CompensationYou may claim maintenance or alimony from your husband on the basis of your needs and his ability, particularly because you have suffered mental harassment throughout the marriage. Demanding a certain lump sum amount of ₹1 crore as damages for mental anguish and wasted time is not easy or automatic under the law.Courts look at circumstances such as the length of marriage, mental cruelty, financial condition of both individuals, and adversity endured. You may approach through court processes for alimony or compensation, but the quantum is within the discretion of the court and proof of adversity or cruelty. As you are earning more than your husband, the court would consider this in allocating maintenance, but mental harassment and evidence of adultery can make your demand for compensation much stronger.Property and Financial Settlements under Mutual DivorceSection 13-BHindu Marriage Actmutual divorce involves both parties' consent, including acceptance of financial settlements like alimony and asset division. Property held exclusively by one spouse usually stays with the spouse unless the other spouse is able to establish contribution or joint ownership. Jewellery and gifts that fall under the category of Stridhan are not divisible and stay with the wife.Jewellery Given by In-LawsJewels received from your in-laws are yours (Stridhan) and you are entitled to all rights over them, even after divorce. Your husband cannot ask for it unless proved that it was given or shared jointly or gifted to him.Practical Tips for Friendly SettlementAs your husband is seeking an amicable mutual divorce, negotiate clearly as follows:Keep all jewellery and gifts received by you.Leave out the furniture from the settlement if you do not wish to have it.Negotiate reasonable alimony or compensation according to your mental harassment and economic needs.Put all agreements on paper in the mutual divorce petition so that any future disputes can be avoided.You may also consult a lawyer to prepare a fair settlement agreement and protect your rights while going through the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Based on the facts presented, you are entitled to seek and negotiate a comprehensive settlement in amutual consent divorcethat accounts not only for your streedhan and marital contributions but also for the emotional and mental trauma you’ve endured over the course of your marriage. Under Indian law, all jewellery, valuables, and gifts received by you before, during, and after the marriage from your family form part of yourstreedhan— and you have an absolute legal right to reclaim the same, including any selective gifts you may wish to exclude such as furniture. Jewellery and valuables gifted by your in-laws, unless proven to be given jointly to both spouses, also fall under your personal entitlement. In amutual consent divorce, you may demand not just the return of streedhan but also a one-timelump sum alimony/settlementamount — in your case, you can justifiably seek Rs. 1 crore or higher, especially given the 14-year relationship, the betrayal, and the emotional suffering. While there is no strict formula under law for quantifying compensation in mutual divorce, it is entirely valid to raise such a demand, particularly when your husband is eager to dissolve the marriage swiftly and avoid litigation. You should ensure that all your terms — including return of jewellery, gifts, and financial compensation — are clearly recorded in a writtenMutual Divorce Settlement Agreementto be signed before filing the joint petition under Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act. You may also insert a clause in the agreement that ensures the full and final settlement is executed before the second motion of divorce, to protect your interests. It is advisable that you proceed through a lawyer to ensure your legal rights are protected in the drafting and execution of the agreement.

Make a police complaint or anticipatory bail plea if you fear false FIRs. Report to your department to safeguard your service. It is advised that for you to not confront and leave it to your lawyer to handle communications.Dowry harassment or cruelty cases can be instituted at any time during marriage, but courts give weight to long peaceful cohabitation.

Your video evidence refuting dowry is important.Counter-Cases: You may choose to lodge counter FIRs for defamation, criminal intimidation, or false complaints if false cases are filed against you or your parents. The evidence such as call recordings, video evidence, neighbor/maid testimony, and any written evidence will also hold value in court.Child Custody: The Courts give utmost importance to children's well-being. Therefore, the custody or visitation rights can be shared. You are adivsed to seek the services of a family lawyer to make custody petitions safeguarding your parental rights.Protecting Older Parents: Parents can be safeguarded by seeking anticipatory bail or making police complaints in case of threats.The courts do not readily agree to arrest of older parents unless on substantial reasons.Mental Health Documentation: Psychiatric counseling and keeping medical records can lend credibility to alleging mental harassment and stress.Divorce Process Under Muslim Law: You may approach divorce through talaq or mutual consent (mubarat).  Judicial intervention can be sought under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage",
    "answer": "As a 41-year-old Muslim man contemplating divorce after 14 years of marriage, it is prudent to take certain pre-emptive legal measures to safeguard yourself and your elderly parents from potential false allegations. You should begin by documenting all relevant facts in a notarised affidavit stating there was no dowry demand or harassment, supported by the video recording where your wife and father-in-law have admitted the same. Additionally, preserve all digital evidence such as call recordings, messages, and any interactions that indicate emotional abuse or maligning of your character. You may also consider filing a precautionary General Diary (GD) or Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at the local police station expressing apprehension of false cases. Although dowry ordomestic violencecomplaints can still be filed after 14 years, their evidentiary value is significantly weakened due to the long delay, particularly when parties have cohabited peacefully in the interim. If false cases are initiated, you are entitled to file counter-complaints under Sections 182 and 211 of the IPC and may pursue a defamation case. To protect your children’s interests, it is advisable to initiate a custody petition under the Guardians and Wards Act and maintain a record of your active involvement in their upbringing. Given your concern about the mental toll of the marriage, consulting a psychiatrist to document stress may also support your case, particularly if false mental harassment allegations are made. Lastly, you must keep your elderly parents distanced from marital conflicts and avoid any direct or volatile communication with your wife to shield them from unnecessary legal complications. Seeking timely legal counsel and maintaining calm, factual communication will help you handle this situation ethically and lawfully.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

Should Nikhil appear at Police Station without a formal court notice or summons?No, he isnot legally boundto appear merely based on aphone call, especially if:Nonotice under Section 41A CrPChas been served, andNosummons or warranthas been issued by a competent court.However, to avoid escalation, Nikhil may:Send aformal communication via an advocateto the police expressing willingness to cooperate, andSeek details of any pending court proceedings.2. Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Appearance at Police Station or Court: Since your friend has not received any court summons or official notice, there isno legal obligationto appear at the police station based solely on a phone call from someone claiming to be aPeshkar. Such unofficial communications should be approached with caution. Your friend shouldinsist on a written notice or summonthrough proper legal channels. If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "answer": "- Yes, you can take his consent for mutual divorce , and which can be granted within a short period of time.- Your affair cannot be a ground for the refusal of custody of the daughter.- Under the Guardian and Ward Act, , the welfare of the child as the paramount importance, like ethical upbringing of the child, Safe-keeping of the child, Good education , and economic well-being of the guardian.- Further, as per the Supreme Court, for the custody of the minor, the only consideration is the welfare of the minor.- Under Hindu law, A mother usually gets custody of the minor child, under the age of 5 and fathers get custody of older boys, but it is not a strict rule and is primarily decided based on the child’s interests.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Can I get the custody of my 5 year old daughter with mutual consent divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "question": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage",
    "answer": "As a 41-year-old Muslim man contemplating divorce after 14 years of marriage, it is prudent to take certain pre-emptive legal measures to safeguard yourself and your elderly parents from potential false allegations. You should begin by documenting all relevant facts in a notarised affidavit stating there was no dowry demand or harassment, supported by the video recording where your wife and father-in-law have admitted the same. Additionally, preserve all digital evidence such as call recordings, messages, and any interactions that indicate emotional abuse or maligning of your character. You may also consider filing a precautionary General Diary (GD) or Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at the local police station expressing apprehension of false cases. Although dowry ordomestic violencecomplaints can still be filed after 14 years, their evidentiary value is significantly weakened due to the long delay, particularly when parties have cohabited peacefully in the interim. If false cases are initiated, you are entitled to file counter-complaints under Sections 182 and 211 of the IPC and may pursue a defamation case. To protect your children’s interests, it is advisable to initiate a custody petition under the Guardians and Wards Act and maintain a record of your active involvement in their upbringing. Given your concern about the mental toll of the marriage, consulting a psychiatrist to document stress may also support your case, particularly if false mental harassment allegations are made. Lastly, you must keep your elderly parents distanced from marital conflicts and avoid any direct or volatile communication with your wife to shield them from unnecessary legal complications. Seeking timely legal counsel and maintaining calm, factual communication will help you handle this situation ethically and lawfully.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce Case and CSRs Have No Bearing on SSC MTS RecruitmentCases of divorce pending or CSRs on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations do not disqualify candidates for SSC MTS or other government employment. Convictions in criminal cases alone (e.g., FIRs resulting in chargesheets) may affect employment. CSRs are loose police entries and have no legal bearing unless they are transformed into an FIR.During Document Verification give only necessary documents (educational certificates, caste/age proofs, etc.). Do not give information about the divorce case or CSRs unless asked specifically..You can take the help of a lawyer and state that the divorce case is a civil case not related to employment eligibility. CSRs are non-judicial documents and are not criminal charges with the help of precedents.Protection Against False Allegations : In case the department unjustifiably postpones joining because of the cases:Petition a writ in the High Court under Article 226 to invoke the right to employment.

    "answer": "Dear ClientThe provisions stated above does essentially hold you responsible for lifetime compensation, which is a onerous and unlimited commitment.Important points:Indemnity clauses are common for covering the buyer against title defects or legal problems resulting from the vendor's side. This is normal and reasonable.The expression however making you liable \"at all times\" and from \"personal and other properties\" is broad and has the potential to make you liable in the future to any extent, which is not normal or desirable.As the buyer originally agreed to your conditions but subsequently included this burdensome condition in the sale deed, you have a sound reason to object to execution or even rescind the agreement if the condition was not agreed to by both parties.You may insist on a limited indemnity clause that protects only against losses arising out of defects in title or contractual breaches and not lifetime or unlimitedAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

Should Nikhil appear at Police Station without a formal court notice or summons?No, he isnot legally boundto appear merely based on aphone call, especially if:Nonotice under Section 41A CrPChas been served, andNosummons or warranthas been issued by a competent court.However, to avoid escalation, Nikhil may:Send aformal communication via an advocateto the police expressing willingness to cooperate, andSeek details of any pending court proceedings.2. Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Such unofficial communications should be approached with caution. Your friend shouldinsist on a written notice or summonthrough proper legal channels. If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

Make a police complaint or anticipatory bail plea if you fear false FIRs. Report to your department to safeguard your service. It is advised that for you to not confront and leave it to your lawyer to handle communications.Dowry harassment or cruelty cases can be instituted at any time during marriage, but courts give weight to long peaceful cohabitation. Delayed allegations are more difficult to establish but not impossible. Your video evidence refuting dowry is important.Counter-Cases: You may choose to lodge counter FIRs for defamation, criminal intimidation, or false complaints if false cases are filed against you or your parents. The evidence such as call recordings, video evidence, neighbor/maid testimony, and any written evidence will also hold value in court.Child Custody: The Courts give utmost importance to children's well-being. Therefore, the custody or visitation rights can be shared. You are adivsed to seek the services of a family lawyer to make custody petitions safeguarding your parental rights.Protecting Older Parents: Parents can be safeguarded by seeking anticipatory bail or making police complaints in case of threats.The courts do not readily agree to arrest of older parents unless on substantial reasons.Mental Health Documentation: Psychiatric counseling and keeping medical records can lend credibility to alleging mental harassment and stress.Divorce Process Under Muslim Law: You may approach divorce through talaq or mutual consent (mubarat).  Judicial intervention can be sought under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage",
    "answer": "As a 41-year-old Muslim man contemplating divorce after 14 years of marriage, it is prudent to take certain pre-emptive legal measures to safeguard yourself and your elderly parents from potential false allegations. You should begin by documenting all relevant facts in a notarised affidavit stating there was no dowry demand or harassment, supported by the video recording where your wife and father-in-law have admitted the same. Additionally, preserve all digital evidence such as call recordings, messages, and any interactions that indicate emotional abuse or maligning of your character. You may also consider filing a precautionary General Diary (GD) or Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at the local police station expressing apprehension of false cases. Although dowry ordomestic violencecomplaints can still be filed after 14 years, their evidentiary value is significantly weakened due to the long delay, particularly when parties have cohabited peacefully in the interim. If false cases are initiated, you are entitled to file counter-complaints under Sections 182 and 211 of the IPC and may pursue a defamation case. To protect your children’s interests, it is advisable to initiate a custody petition under the Guardians and Wards Act and maintain a record of your active involvement in their upbringing. Given your concern about the mental toll of the marriage, consulting a psychiatrist to document stress may also support your case, particularly if false mental harassment allegations are made. Lastly, you must keep your elderly parents distanced from marital conflicts and avoid any direct or volatile communication with your wife to shield them from unnecessary legal complications. Seeking timely legal counsel and maintaining calm, factual communication will help you handle this situation ethically and lawfully.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

Should Nikhil appear at Police Station without a formal court notice or summons?No, he isnot legally boundto appear merely based on aphone call, especially if:Nonotice under Section 41A CrPChas been served, andNosummons or warranthas been issued by a competent court.However, to avoid escalation, Nikhil may:Send aformal communication via an advocateto the police expressing willingness to cooperate, andSeek details of any pending court proceedings.2. Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

    "question": "Can I get the custody of my 5 year old daughter with mutual consent divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

All the property transactions are registered at the Sub-Registrar's office where the property is situated. After that, you can apply for certified copies of registered documents (sale deed, release deed, etc.) in your name by submitting your identification details and property details on the same.You can choose to utilize the State Government Online Portals for Property Records. Most of the Indian states have official web portals for property registration and land records, e.g.: Kaveri Online Registration (Karnataka), IGR Maharashtra (Maharashtra), the Delhi Online Registry (Delhi) and so on. On these portals , you can view your ownership information, transaction history, and then download the certified copies of documents by providing your name, property registration number, survey or plot number and other relevant details. Get Encumbrance Certificate (EC). The EC obtained from the Sub-Registrar office reflects all dealings relating to the property and ensures that it is clear of any encumbrances (loans, mortgages). It can be procured online or offline. Verify Mutation Records and Land Revenue Documents. Mutation records in the local municipal or revenue office verify the change in ownership in government records. Patta or Record of Rights (RoR) documents also validate ownership status.Documents You May Need to FurnishYour complete name and identification (Aadhaar, PAN)Details of property (address, survey number, registration number if known)Old property documents if you have them (even photocopies)If you Need Certified Copies , make application at the Sub-Registrar office or online portal for certified copies of registered deeds.

    "question": "Deficiency of service",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Affidavit Language Issues The affidavit says you \"have neither used nor intend to use the services,\" suggesting the switch of service provider was your independent decision. This disregards the fact that you were compelled to switch because of their inability to produce documents. It also holds the service provider harmless for claims but fails to include any refund amount or express guarantee of refund payment. Presenting such an affidavit would dilute your legal stand and exonerate them from responsibility without ensuring your refund. Refund Rights and Contractual Obligations As you have paid INR 20,000 plus GST for a non-delivered service (because of their refusal of documents), you are entitled to a refund or compensation. Their insistence on an affidavit prior to refund seems to be an attempt to evade or delay refund. Unless the terms and conditions or the contract specifically demand such an affidavit, you are not required to provide it. Suggested Legal Course of Action Do not file the affidavit in its present form. Instead, ask for a written confirmation of the refund amount and duration in clear terms. If they deny or delay, issue a legal notice for refund of the amount paid on grounds of breach of contract and non-delivery of agreed services. Specify in the notice that you have the right to initiate consumer complaint proceedings for damages and recovery in case refund is not given immediately. Document all communications for evidence. Negotiation and Drafting Affidavit In case you wish to resolve amicably, negotiate affidavit terms clearly: Identifying the refund amount and date. Not waiving your rights or indemnifying them unjustly. Reflecting that the switch of service provider was on account of their default.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "question": "Power of Attorney or Will",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Power of Attorney (PoA) for Managing Property in ChennaiA Power of Attorney (PoA) is a legal instrument wherein your father (the Principal) appoints you (the Agent) to deal with his property in Chennai on his behalf. You may pay rent, pay property taxes, or even sell the property, if authorized. Since your father is 88 years old and as he cannot move to Chennai for registration, you have the following alternatives:a. PoA Execution and Registration:The PoA should be signed in the presence of witnesses and executed on stamp paper by your father. Registration of the PoA at the Sub-Registrar's office in Chennai is necessary for property transactions (sale) under the Registration Act, 1908. If your father is unable to go to Chennai, he can sign the PoA in Bangalore in front of a Sub-Registrar or a Notary Public. The PoA may be forwarded to Chennai for registration. Your father may also sign the PoA in front of an Indian Consulate or Embassy if he is outside India (not applicable in this case because he is in Bangalore). You can hire a lawyer in Chennai to carry out the registration after the PoA is signed and forwarded from Bangalore.2.Types of PoA:General Power of Attorney (GPA): Wide powers to conduct all matters concerning the property.Special Power of Attorney (SPA): Restricted to particular activities, e.g., collection of rent or sale of the property. As you would like to manage the property actively, a Registered General Power of Attorney in Chennai is recommended. A Will is a legal instrument that defines how your father's property will be divided after his death to the people. It does not provide the power to deal with or sell the property during his lifetime. Hence, a Will cannot serve as a substitute for a Power of Attorney if the intention is to deal or  manage the property presently. A Will only comes into force upon the death of the testator and has to be probated to take legal effect. If your father wishes to have peace of mind in terms of smooth succession on his death, he must draft a Will apart from the PoA for current management.3. You are advised to contact a lawyer who can help you with the following :Preparing and executing of the Power of Attorney documents. Further also help you with the process of registration of PoA in Tamil Nadu (Chennai). Assist you with the Estate planning such as Wills and succession issues. Cross-jurisdictional property issues (Bangalore-Chennai).There are numerous skilled property lawyers in Bangalore who can prepare the PoA and assist you in notarization and registration procedures. They can even arrange with a Chennai-based advocate for registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The follwing are the analysis and asnwers to your questions.1. Why is the court not expediting to cancel the settlement deed in light of alleged fraud and manipulation?Civil property cases, particularly ones involving fraud, coercion, or undue influence, are time-consuming because fact-finding, production of evidence, and arguments at law need time.Courts observe procedural fairness and permit each party to lay their case out, and it leads to delay. The court cannot arbitrarily cancel a registered settlement deed without adequate evidence of fraud or coercion and a trial.

    "answer": "Given the serious allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and undue influence over elderly parents in executing asettlement deed, your case raises important concerns both civilly and criminally. Here is legal advice addressing each of your concerns in a structured manner:1. Delay in Court Proceedings:Indian civil courts are often overburdened, and unless interim relief is sought aggressively, cases involving cancellation of documents such as settlement deeds can take years. However, since the settlement was allegedly obtained byfraud and manipulation of elderly persons, your advocate shouldmove an application for interim injunctionunder Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of the CPC torestrain the distant relative from further alienating, leasing, or altering the propertyduring pendency of the suit. If your counsel hasn't done this yet, it is a serious lapse and must be addressed immediately.2. Illegal Use and Profiting During Case:If noinjunctionwas obtained at the time of filing, the defendant can legally use the property unless restrained by court order. Theimmediate remedyis to file aninjunction applicationstating that the continued use, felling of trees, and rental income is causingirreparable loss, and pray that the possession or profits be frozen or directed to be held in court trust (court receivercan be appointed). Additionally, a complaint to the police can be filed underSection 420IPC (cheating) andSection 406IPC (criminal breach of trust) if the signature was obtained fraudulently or under deception.3. Steps to Speed Up Cancellation of Settlement Deed:Ensure a strong interim injunction application is on recordand argue for urgent hearing.File awrit petitionbefore the High Court seeking direction for time-bound disposal if the lower court is not moving forward.Simultaneously, considercriminal actionfor cheating and criminal intimidation if threats or coercion were involved. Criminal proceedings can sometimes exert necessary pressure.Keep applying forearly hearingunder Section 151 CPC.4. If Parents Pass Away During the Case:If either or both of your parents pass away, theright to sue survivesunder Order 22 of CPC. You, as legal heirs, can be substituted as plaintiffs. However, delay in substitution may abate the suit. So, keep a vigilant eye on your parents' health and be prepared with legal heirship proof to file for substitution immediately if needed.5. Weight of a Will in Favour of Children:If your parents execute aregistered Willin your favour now, itwill not override the already executed registered settlement deed, unless the latter is cancelled.

    "question": "Power of Attorney or Will",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Power of Attorney (PoA) for Managing Property in ChennaiA Power of Attorney (PoA) is a legal instrument wherein your father (the Principal) appoints you (the Agent) to deal with his property in Chennai on his behalf. You may pay rent, pay property taxes, or even sell the property, if authorized. Since your father is 88 years old and as he cannot move to Chennai for registration, you have the following alternatives:a. PoA Execution and Registration:The PoA should be signed in the presence of witnesses and executed on stamp paper by your father. Registration of the PoA at the Sub-Registrar's office in Chennai is necessary for property transactions (sale) under the Registration Act, 1908. If your father is unable to go to Chennai, he can sign the PoA in Bangalore in front of a Sub-Registrar or a Notary Public. The PoA may be forwarded to Chennai for registration. Your father may also sign the PoA in front of an Indian Consulate or Embassy if he is outside India (not applicable in this case because he is in Bangalore). You can hire a lawyer in Chennai to carry out the registration after the PoA is signed and forwarded from Bangalore.2.Types of PoA:General Power of Attorney (GPA): Wide powers to conduct all matters concerning the property.Special Power of Attorney (SPA): Restricted to particular activities, e.g., collection of rent or sale of the property. As you would like to manage the property actively, a Registered General Power of Attorney in Chennai is recommended. A Will is a legal instrument that defines how your father's property will be divided after his death to the people. It does not provide the power to deal with or sell the property during his lifetime. Hence, a Will cannot serve as a substitute for a Power of Attorney if the intention is to deal or  manage the property presently. A Will only comes into force upon the death of the testator and has to be probated to take legal effect. If your father wishes to have peace of mind in terms of smooth succession on his death, he must draft a Will apart from the PoA for current management.3. You are advised to contact a lawyer who can help you with the following :Preparing and executing of the Power of Attorney documents. Further also help you with the process of registration of PoA in Tamil Nadu (Chennai). Assist you with the Estate planning such as Wills and succession issues. Cross-jurisdictional property issues (Bangalore-Chennai).There are numerous skilled property lawyers in Bangalore who can prepare the PoA and assist you in notarization and registration procedures. They can even arrange with a Chennai-based advocate for registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The follwing are the analysis and asnwers to your questions.1. Why is the court not expediting to cancel the settlement deed in light of alleged fraud and manipulation?Civil property cases, particularly ones involving fraud, coercion, or undue influence, are time-consuming because fact-finding, production of evidence, and arguments at law need time.Courts observe procedural fairness and permit each party to lay their case out, and it leads to delay. The court cannot arbitrarily cancel a registered settlement deed without adequate evidence of fraud or coercion and a trial. The remedy would be to file a suit for cancellation under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, which is discretionary and time-consuming.2. Why can the distant relative take on rent and earn money from the property while the case is still pending?Once the settlement deed is registered, the distant relative is the legal owner until the court rules otherwise.

    "question": "Power of Attorney or Will",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Power of Attorney (PoA) for Managing Property in ChennaiA Power of Attorney (PoA) is a legal instrument wherein your father (the Principal) appoints you (the Agent) to deal with his property in Chennai on his behalf. You may pay rent, pay property taxes, or even sell the property, if authorized. Since your father is 88 years old and as he cannot move to Chennai for registration, you have the following alternatives:a. PoA Execution and Registration:The PoA should be signed in the presence of witnesses and executed on stamp paper by your father. Registration of the PoA at the Sub-Registrar's office in Chennai is necessary for property transactions (sale) under the Registration Act, 1908. If your father is unable to go to Chennai, he can sign the PoA in Bangalore in front of a Sub-Registrar or a Notary Public. The PoA may be forwarded to Chennai for registration. Your father may also sign the PoA in front of an Indian Consulate or Embassy if he is outside India (not applicable in this case because he is in Bangalore). You can hire a lawyer in Chennai to carry out the registration after the PoA is signed and forwarded from Bangalore.2.Types of PoA:General Power of Attorney (GPA): Wide powers to conduct all matters concerning the property.Special Power of Attorney (SPA): Restricted to particular activities, e.g., collection of rent or sale of the property. As you would like to manage the property actively, a Registered General Power of Attorney in Chennai is recommended. A Will is a legal instrument that defines how your father's property will be divided after his death to the people. It does not provide the power to deal with or sell the property during his lifetime. Hence, a Will cannot serve as a substitute for a Power of Attorney if the intention is to deal or  manage the property presently. A Will only comes into force upon the death of the testator and has to be probated to take legal effect. If your father wishes to have peace of mind in terms of smooth succession on his death, he must draft a Will apart from the PoA for current management.3. You are advised to contact a lawyer who can help you with the following :Preparing and executing of the Power of Attorney documents. Further also help you with the process of registration of PoA in Tamil Nadu (Chennai). Assist you with the Estate planning such as Wills and succession issues. Cross-jurisdictional property issues (Bangalore-Chennai).There are numerous skilled property lawyers in Bangalore who can prepare the PoA and assist you in notarization and registration procedures. They can even arrange with a Chennai-based advocate for registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 25 days ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The follwing are the analysis and asnwers to your questions.1. Why is the court not expediting to cancel the settlement deed in light of alleged fraud and manipulation?Civil property cases, particularly ones involving fraud, coercion, or undue influence, are time-consuming because fact-finding, production of evidence, and arguments at law need time.Courts observe procedural fairness and permit each party to lay their case out, and it leads to delay. The court cannot arbitrarily cancel a registered settlement deed without adequate evidence of fraud or coercion and a trial. The remedy would be to file a suit for cancellation under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, which is discretionary and time-consuming.2. Why can the distant relative take on rent and earn money from the property while the case is still pending?Once the settlement deed is registered, the distant relative is the legal owner until the court rules otherwise. Courts do not normally interfere with possession or use of property during litigation unless a temporary injunction or stay order is issued.Unless you have obtained a temporary injunction restraining the relative from renting or alienating the property, they legally can continue possession and earn income.3. What can be done to expedite cancellation and retrieve property from your parents?Plead for early hearing or relief (interim injunction) to stop the relative from dealing with the property during the suit.Lay robust documentary and witness evidence establishing fraud, manipulation, and incapacity of your elderly parents to execute the deed knowingly. Appoint a skilled advocate to press for case listing and speed up proceedings. Negotiate mediation or settlement if possible, but if the relative does not agree, proceed with litigation.Sue for criminal fraud or forgery if supported by evidence, which can also bring pressure.4. What if your parents get ill or die during the case?The case can be proceeded with by their legal representatives or legal heirs.Their inability or death does not necessarily invalidate the suit; successors can fill their shoes to carry on the claim. It is recommended that a power of attorney or legal guardian be appointed to handle proceedings if parents are unable.5. What value is your parents' assertion that property should belong to their children?Your parents' intention or spoken words are significant but not decisive without written evidence (Will or registered document). Courts mainly use registered deeds and documentary proof. But proof of manipulation and deprivation of consent can be in your favor to get back property to parents and ultimately to heirsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir/Madam,The point wise reply of your queries may be as follows:1> why court is taking so long for a case involving fraud and manipulation of elderly and settlement deed signed is not cancelled ? It now a 1.5 yearsIt is quite possible that the Trial Court is might burdened by the pendency of so much cases with it and may not be taking your case with so much priority. In these circumstances, you may proceed to high court for a direction to the Trial Court for timely disposal of the matter.2. While case is going on why is distant cousin allowed to manipulate property and rent and make profit as it is prime realestate ?It is not possible to figure out from your query that whether you have filed an application under order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of CPC for retstraining your cousin from restaining from maniputing the proeprty and rest and making the profit of the property in question. If not filed earlier, you are suggested to file and get the favourable order. If it already filed and order passed by the Court already, then file the contempt petition.3. What can be done to speed up the cancellation of settlement deed and return deed back to my parents.The process already explained in reply to queries of point 1.4. What happens if both my parents get sick or passes while ongoing court case ?In the case of any uneventuality, you may suceed your parents as the plaintiff.5. My parents will state that property and land would go to their children - what weight does that have on the case ?For that option, you may get a valid and registered WILL from the parents.Ganesh SinghAdvocate, New Delhi6928 Answers16 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ganesh Singh"

    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Given the serious allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and undue influence over elderly parents in executing asettlement deed, your case raises important concerns both civilly and criminally. Here is legal advice addressing each of your concerns in a structured manner:1. Delay in Court Proceedings:Indian civil courts are often overburdened, and unless interim relief is sought aggressively, cases involving cancellation of documents such as settlement deeds can take years. However, since the settlement was allegedly obtained byfraud and manipulation of elderly persons, your advocate shouldmove an application for interim injunctionunder Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of the CPC torestrain the distant relative from further alienating, leasing, or altering the propertyduring pendency of the suit. If your counsel hasn't done this yet, it is a serious lapse and must be addressed immediately.2. Illegal Use and Profiting During Case:If noinjunctionwas obtained at the time of filing, the defendant can legally use the property unless restrained by court order. Theimmediate remedyis to file aninjunction applicationstating that the continued use, felling of trees, and rental income is causingirreparable loss, and pray that the possession or profits be frozen or directed to be held in court trust (court receivercan be appointed). Additionally, a complaint to the police can be filed underSection 420IPC (cheating) andSection 406IPC (criminal breach of trust) if the signature was obtained fraudulently or under deception.3. Steps to Speed Up Cancellation of Settlement Deed:Ensure a strong interim injunction application is on recordand argue for urgent hearing.File awrit petitionbefore the High Court seeking direction for time-bound disposal if the lower court is not moving forward.Simultaneously, considercriminal actionfor cheating and criminal intimidation if threats or coercion were involved. Criminal proceedings can sometimes exert necessary pressure.Keep applying forearly hearingunder Section 151 CPC.4. If Parents Pass Away During the Case:If either or both of your parents pass away, theright to sue survivesunder Order 22 of CPC. You, as legal heirs, can be substituted as plaintiffs. However, delay in substitution may abate the suit. So, keep a vigilant eye on your parents' health and be prepared with legal heirship proof to file for substitution immediately if needed.5. Weight of a Will in Favour of Children:If your parents execute aregistered Willin your favour now, itwill not override the already executed registered settlement deed, unless the latter is cancelled. However, it will showtheir clear intentionand could support the claim that the original deed was obtainedwithout understanding and against their will. Such a Will can beused as corroborative evidencein your current civil suit.Immediate Legal Strategy:Injunction Petition– File or press for urgent hearing.Police Complaint– File underIPC 406& 420 for criminal pressure.Writ in High Court– For time-bound disposal.Will Execution– Get a registered Will made to reaffirm their intent.Press for Court Receiver– To manage rental income till final decision.Conclusion:This is aserious case of property fraud involving elderly personsand must be handled both oncivil and criminal fronts. Your counsel must aggressively pursue interim remedies to stop ongoing damage. Delay is often due to passive litigation — you must now push for urgent listing and also explore filing acriminal complaintto escalate the matter.If you need help with drafting a strong interim application or criminal complaint, I can assist you further.

Indian courts can take jurisdiction if either of the parties is a resident or domiciled in India. She can approach the family court or the district court where she is living in India.2. Recognition of Foreign Marriages and DivorceMarriages and divorces registered outside India are usually accepted in India if registered at the Indian embassy or consulate or when the parties subsequently register the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.If the marriage was not registered in India, she may still get a divorce in India on the basis of the marriage certificate obtained in UAE or other proof of marriage. Divorce orders issued in UAE can be challenged or accepted in India based on procedural adherence and jurisdiction.3. Ground and Procedure for Divorce in IndiaIndian courts tend to sympathize with wives who approach them for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty or desertion, such as cases of conversion or fraudulent inducement4. UAE Court OptionsUAE courts follow Sharia law for Muslim marriages, and she can still approach them for divorce. Divorce in UAE is followed by mandatory attempts at reconciliation at the Family Guidance Section prior to court proceedings. If reconciliation does not work, the court goes ahead with divorce on evidence available.But even if she cannot get relief from UAE courts, filing in India is still an option5. Other Legal RemediesShe can also seek the legal support and advice of the Indian embassy or consulate in UAE. She can also seek assistance from NGOs or legal aid groups that help Indian women with matrimonial problems abroad. If there is any aspect of fraud or coercion involved in the marriage or conversion, she can bring these matters before Indian courts tooAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife asking in writing to come back",
    "answer": "Dear client,The following points are duly to be noted1. Demand for Maintenance by Your WifeAs no maintenance proceeding or court order is already existing, your wife's demand for ₹35,000 a month is not enforceable as of right. According to Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, a spouse is entitled to claim maintenance in proceedings for divorce or judicial separation, but in the absence of any such proceedings, there is no duty to pay monthly maintenance simply because she makes a demand. However, if you want to make amends, and if you wish to do that by providing reasonable financial assistance as a gesture of good faith you choose to do that , but is not legally enforceable unless so ordered by the court.2. Written Undertaking as to BehaviourYour wife requesting written guarantees that you will not physically assault or emotionally abuse her, even where there have been no previous incidents, is really a precautionary or confidence-building measure on her part. There is no statutory requirement to give such written statements unless there are complaints or allegations of cruelty ordomestic violence. If you truly wish to reconcile, giving a written undertaking of good behaviour can assist in the establishment of trust, but it is not statutory.3. Legal Framework for ReconciliationAccording to Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, where one of the spouses relinquishes the other's society without sufficient reason, the aggrieved spouse may make a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights, which is a judicial measure for re-establishment of cohabitation. Reconciliation and mediation are encouraged by courts before a divorce is granted, according to Section 23 of the Act and Family Courts Act provisions. If you do wish to reconcile, you can look at mediation or counselling to deal with the issues beneath.4. Your Rights and What to Do NextYou are not under any obligation at law to pay maintenance or give written undertakings except in the case of a court order or legal action. You can signal your desire to reconcile but state that any financial help or undertakings must be agreed between you and not sought unilaterally. If your wife demands terms that you think are unreasonable, you can seek legal counsel or mediation to iron out differences amicably. In case of failure to reconcile, either of the parties may seek divorce under grounds mentioned in theHindu Marriage Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client ,The Rights and Claims in Mutual Divorce under the Hindu LawThe Jewellery presented by your family at the time of your marriage is typically treated as Stridhan, so it is the wife's sole property according to Hindu law. This implies that you have the right to keep all the jewellery presented to you by your family, and that your husband cannot claim any of it in divorce under the Hindu Law. The Gifts that you receive from your in-laws are also generally considered to be Stridhan and they all also solely belong to you. You can retain such gifts unless you have specifically given them to your husband or if you are in joint ownership and the same is established. Costly gifts offered during the marriage are generally considered your personal property if they were offered to you, and you can retain those in the division of assets in the divorce.Furniture and Other AssetsAs you do not desire the furniture, you can keep it out of the mutual settlement in divorce. Property division largely hinges on contribution and ownership. If the furniture is jointly held or in the name of your husband, you can opt out of claiming it.Financial Claims and CompensationYou may claim maintenance or alimony from your husband on the basis of your needs and his ability, particularly because you have suffered mental harassment throughout the marriage. Demanding a certain lump sum amount of ₹1 crore as damages for mental anguish and wasted time is not easy or automatic under the law.Courts look at circumstances such as the length of marriage, mental cruelty, financial condition of both individuals, and adversity endured. You may approach through court processes for alimony or compensation, but the quantum is within the discretion of the court and proof of adversity or cruelty. As you are earning more than your husband, the court would consider this in allocating maintenance, but mental harassment and evidence of adultery can make your demand for compensation much stronger.Property and Financial Settlements under Mutual DivorceSection 13-BHindu Marriage Actmutual divorce involves both parties' consent, including acceptance of financial settlements like alimony and asset division. Property held exclusively by one spouse usually stays with the spouse unless the other spouse is able to establish contribution or joint ownership. Jewellery and gifts that fall under the category of Stridhan are not divisible and stay with the wife.Jewellery Given by In-LawsJewels received from your in-laws are yours (Stridhan) and you are entitled to all rights over them, even after divorce. Your husband cannot ask for it unless proved that it was given or shared jointly or gifted to him.Practical Tips for Friendly SettlementAs your husband is seeking an amicable mutual divorce, negotiate clearly as follows:Keep all jewellery and gifts received by you.Leave out the furniture from the settlement if you do not wish to have it.Negotiate reasonable alimony or compensation according to your mental harassment and economic needs.Put all agreements on paper in the mutual divorce petition so that any future disputes can be avoided.You may also consult a lawyer to prepare a fair settlement agreement and protect your rights while going through the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Based on the facts presented, you are entitled to seek and negotiate a comprehensive settlement in amutual consent divorcethat accounts not only for your streedhan and marital contributions but also for the emotional and mental trauma you’ve endured over the course of your marriage. Under Indian law, all jewellery, valuables, and gifts received by you before, during, and after the marriage from your family form part of yourstreedhan— and you have an absolute legal right to reclaim the same, including any selective gifts you may wish to exclude such as furniture. Jewellery and valuables gifted by your in-laws, unless proven to be given jointly to both spouses, also fall under your personal entitlement. In amutual consent divorce, you may demand not just the return of streedhan but also a one-timelump sum alimony/settlementamount — in your case, you can justifiably seek Rs. 1 crore or higher, especially given the 14-year relationship, the betrayal, and the emotional suffering. While there is no strict formula under law for quantifying compensation in mutual divorce, it is entirely valid to raise such a demand, particularly when your husband is eager to dissolve the marriage swiftly and avoid litigation. You should ensure that all your terms — including return of jewellery, gifts, and financial compensation — are clearly recorded in a writtenMutual Divorce Settlement Agreementto be signed before filing the joint petition under Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act. You may also insert a clause in the agreement that ensures the full and final settlement is executed before the second motion of divorce, to protect your interests. It is advisable that you proceed through a lawyer to ensure your legal rights are protected in the drafting and execution of the agreement.

If her husband or any other member of his family who are in possession of such property, dishonestly misappropriate or refuse to return the same, they may be liable to punishment for the offence of criminal breach of trust under sections 405 and 406 IPC.- Hence, your husband is under obligation to return all the stridhan which you got at the time of marriage , even that items were given by your husband family members or relative.- Further, even after getting mutual divorce you can lodge a complaint against him if he not returns those items.- Further, if he is not agreed to return those items including alimony then you can refuse for the mutual divorce, and file cases against him.- However, his extra marital affairs can be a ground for divorceyou can contact me , if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client ,The Rights and Claims in Mutual Divorce under the Hindu LawThe Jewellery presented by your family at the time of your marriage is typically treated as Stridhan, so it is the wife's sole property according to Hindu law. This implies that you have the right to keep all the jewellery presented to you by your family, and that your husband cannot claim any of it in divorce under the Hindu Law. The Gifts that you receive from your in-laws are also generally considered to be Stridhan and they all also solely belong to you. You can retain such gifts unless you have specifically given them to your husband or if you are in joint ownership and the same is established. Costly gifts offered during the marriage are generally considered your personal property if they were offered to you, and you can retain those in the division of assets in the divorce.Furniture and Other AssetsAs you do not desire the furniture, you can keep it out of the mutual settlement in divorce. Property division largely hinges on contribution and ownership. If the furniture is jointly held or in the name of your husband, you can opt out of claiming it.Financial Claims and CompensationYou may claim maintenance or alimony from your husband on the basis of your needs and his ability, particularly because you have suffered mental harassment throughout the marriage. Demanding a certain lump sum amount of ₹1 crore as damages for mental anguish and wasted time is not easy or automatic under the law.Courts look at circumstances such as the length of marriage, mental cruelty, financial condition of both individuals, and adversity endured. You may approach through court processes for alimony or compensation, but the quantum is within the discretion of the court and proof of adversity or cruelty. As you are earning more than your husband, the court would consider this in allocating maintenance, but mental harassment and evidence of adultery can make your demand for compensation much stronger.Property and Financial Settlements under Mutual DivorceSection 13-BHindu Marriage Actmutual divorce involves both parties' consent, including acceptance of financial settlements like alimony and asset division. Property held exclusively by one spouse usually stays with the spouse unless the other spouse is able to establish contribution or joint ownership. Jewellery and gifts that fall under the category of Stridhan are not divisible and stay with the wife.Jewellery Given by In-LawsJewels received from your in-laws are yours (Stridhan) and you are entitled to all rights over them, even after divorce. Your husband cannot ask for it unless proved that it was given or shared jointly or gifted to him.Practical Tips for Friendly SettlementAs your husband is seeking an amicable mutual divorce, negotiate clearly as follows:Keep all jewellery and gifts received by you.Leave out the furniture from the settlement if you do not wish to have it.Negotiate reasonable alimony or compensation according to your mental harassment and economic needs.Put all agreements on paper in the mutual divorce petition so that any future disputes can be avoided.You may also consult a lawyer to prepare a fair settlement agreement and protect your rights while going through the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Based on the facts presented, you are entitled to seek and negotiate a comprehensive settlement in amutual consent divorcethat accounts not only for your streedhan and marital contributions but also for the emotional and mental trauma you’ve endured over the course of your marriage. Under Indian law, all jewellery, valuables, and gifts received by you before, during, and after the marriage from your family form part of yourstreedhan— and you have an absolute legal right to reclaim the same, including any selective gifts you may wish to exclude such as furniture. Jewellery and valuables gifted by your in-laws, unless proven to be given jointly to both spouses, also fall under your personal entitlement. In amutual consent divorce, you may demand not just the return of streedhan but also a one-timelump sum alimony/settlementamount — in your case, you can justifiably seek Rs. 1 crore or higher, especially given the 14-year relationship, the betrayal, and the emotional suffering. While there is no strict formula under law for quantifying compensation in mutual divorce, it is entirely valid to raise such a demand, particularly when your husband is eager to dissolve the marriage swiftly and avoid litigation. You should ensure that all your terms — including return of jewellery, gifts, and financial compensation — are clearly recorded in a writtenMutual Divorce Settlement Agreementto be signed before filing the joint petition under Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act. You may also insert a clause in the agreement that ensures the full and final settlement is executed before the second motion of divorce, to protect your interests. It is advisable that you proceed through a lawyer to ensure your legal rights are protected in the drafting and execution of the agreement.

    "question": "Wife asking in writing to come back",
    "answer": "Dear client,The following points are duly to be noted1. Demand for Maintenance by Your WifeAs no maintenance proceeding or court order is already existing, your wife's demand for ₹35,000 a month is not enforceable as of right. According to Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, a spouse is entitled to claim maintenance in proceedings for divorce or judicial separation, but in the absence of any such proceedings, there is no duty to pay monthly maintenance simply because she makes a demand. However, if you want to make amends, and if you wish to do that by providing reasonable financial assistance as a gesture of good faith you choose to do that , but is not legally enforceable unless so ordered by the court.2. Written Undertaking as to BehaviourYour wife requesting written guarantees that you will not physically assault or emotionally abuse her, even where there have been no previous incidents, is really a precautionary or confidence-building measure on her part. There is no statutory requirement to give such written statements unless there are complaints or allegations of cruelty ordomestic violence. If you truly wish to reconcile, giving a written undertaking of good behaviour can assist in the establishment of trust, but it is not statutory.3. Legal Framework for ReconciliationAccording to Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, where one of the spouses relinquishes the other's society without sufficient reason, the aggrieved spouse may make a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights, which is a judicial measure for re-establishment of cohabitation. Reconciliation and mediation are encouraged by courts before a divorce is granted, according to Section 23 of the Act and Family Courts Act provisions. If you do wish to reconcile, you can look at mediation or counselling to deal with the issues beneath.4. Your Rights and What to Do NextYou are not under any obligation at law to pay maintenance or give written undertakings except in the case of a court order or legal action. You can signal your desire to reconcile but state that any financial help or undertakings must be agreed between you and not sought unilaterally. If your wife demands terms that you think are unreasonable, you can seek legal counsel or mediation to iron out differences amicably. In case of failure to reconcile, either of the parties may seek divorce under grounds mentioned in theHindu Marriage Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If her husband or any other member of his family who are in possession of such property, dishonestly misappropriate or refuse to return the same, they may be liable to punishment for the offence of criminal breach of trust under sections 405 and 406 IPC.- Hence, your husband is under obligation to return all the stridhan which you got at the time of marriage , even that items were given by your husband family members or relative.- Further, even after getting mutual divorce you can lodge a complaint against him if he not returns those items.- Further, if he is not agreed to return those items including alimony then you can refuse for the mutual divorce, and file cases against him.- However, his extra marital affairs can be a ground for divorceyou can contact me , if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client ,The Rights and Claims in Mutual Divorce under the Hindu LawThe Jewellery presented by your family at the time of your marriage is typically treated as Stridhan, so it is the wife's sole property according to Hindu law. This implies that you have the right to keep all the jewellery presented to you by your family, and that your husband cannot claim any of it in divorce under the Hindu Law. The Gifts that you receive from your in-laws are also generally considered to be Stridhan and they all also solely belong to you. You can retain such gifts unless you have specifically given them to your husband or if you are in joint ownership and the same is established. Costly gifts offered during the marriage are generally considered your personal property if they were offered to you, and you can retain those in the division of assets in the divorce.Furniture and Other AssetsAs you do not desire the furniture, you can keep it out of the mutual settlement in divorce. Property division largely hinges on contribution and ownership. If the furniture is jointly held or in the name of your husband, you can opt out of claiming it.Financial Claims and CompensationYou may claim maintenance or alimony from your husband on the basis of your needs and his ability, particularly because you have suffered mental harassment throughout the marriage. Demanding a certain lump sum amount of ₹1 crore as damages for mental anguish and wasted time is not easy or automatic under the law.Courts look at circumstances such as the length of marriage, mental cruelty, financial condition of both individuals, and adversity endured. You may approach through court processes for alimony or compensation, but the quantum is within the discretion of the court and proof of adversity or cruelty. As you are earning more than your husband, the court would consider this in allocating maintenance, but mental harassment and evidence of adultery can make your demand for compensation much stronger.Property and Financial Settlements under Mutual DivorceSection 13-BHindu Marriage Actmutual divorce involves both parties' consent, including acceptance of financial settlements like alimony and asset division. Property held exclusively by one spouse usually stays with the spouse unless the other spouse is able to establish contribution or joint ownership. Jewellery and gifts that fall under the category of Stridhan are not divisible and stay with the wife.Jewellery Given by In-LawsJewels received from your in-laws are yours (Stridhan) and you are entitled to all rights over them, even after divorce. Your husband cannot ask for it unless proved that it was given or shared jointly or gifted to him.Practical Tips for Friendly SettlementAs your husband is seeking an amicable mutual divorce, negotiate clearly as follows:Keep all jewellery and gifts received by you.Leave out the furniture from the settlement if you do not wish to have it.Negotiate reasonable alimony or compensation according to your mental harassment and economic needs.Put all agreements on paper in the mutual divorce petition so that any future disputes can be avoided.You may also consult a lawyer to prepare a fair settlement agreement and protect your rights while going through the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Based on the facts presented, you are entitled to seek and negotiate a comprehensive settlement in amutual consent divorcethat accounts not only for your streedhan and marital contributions but also for the emotional and mental trauma you’ve endured over the course of your marriage. Under Indian law, all jewellery, valuables, and gifts received by you before, during, and after the marriage from your family form part of yourstreedhan— and you have an absolute legal right to reclaim the same, including any selective gifts you may wish to exclude such as furniture. Jewellery and valuables gifted by your in-laws, unless proven to be given jointly to both spouses, also fall under your personal entitlement. In amutual consent divorce, you may demand not just the return of streedhan but also a one-timelump sum alimony/settlementamount — in your case, you can justifiably seek Rs. 1 crore or higher, especially given the 14-year relationship, the betrayal, and the emotional suffering. While there is no strict formula under law for quantifying compensation in mutual divorce, it is entirely valid to raise such a demand, particularly when your husband is eager to dissolve the marriage swiftly and avoid litigation. You should ensure that all your terms — including return of jewellery, gifts, and financial compensation — are clearly recorded in a writtenMutual Divorce Settlement Agreementto be signed before filing the joint petition under Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act. You may also insert a clause in the agreement that ensures the full and final settlement is executed before the second motion of divorce, to protect your interests. It is advisable that you proceed through a lawyer to ensure your legal rights are protected in the drafting and execution of the agreement.

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client ,The Rights and Claims in Mutual Divorce under the Hindu LawThe Jewellery presented by your family at the time of your marriage is typically treated as Stridhan, so it is the wife's sole property according to Hindu law. This implies that you have the right to keep all the jewellery presented to you by your family, and that your husband cannot claim any of it in divorce under the Hindu Law. The Gifts that you receive from your in-laws are also generally considered to be Stridhan and they all also solely belong to you. You can retain such gifts unless you have specifically given them to your husband or if you are in joint ownership and the same is established. Costly gifts offered during the marriage are generally considered your personal property if they were offered to you, and you can retain those in the division of assets in the divorce.Furniture and Other AssetsAs you do not desire the furniture, you can keep it out of the mutual settlement in divorce. Property division largely hinges on contribution and ownership. If the furniture is jointly held or in the name of your husband, you can opt out of claiming it.Financial Claims and CompensationYou may claim maintenance or alimony from your husband on the basis of your needs and his ability, particularly because you have suffered mental harassment throughout the marriage. Demanding a certain lump sum amount of ₹1 crore as damages for mental anguish and wasted time is not easy or automatic under the law.Courts look at circumstances such as the length of marriage, mental cruelty, financial condition of both individuals, and adversity endured. You may approach through court processes for alimony or compensation, but the quantum is within the discretion of the court and proof of adversity or cruelty. As you are earning more than your husband, the court would consider this in allocating maintenance, but mental harassment and evidence of adultery can make your demand for compensation much stronger.Property and Financial Settlements under Mutual DivorceSection 13-BHindu Marriage Actmutual divorce involves both parties' consent, including acceptance of financial settlements like alimony and asset division. Property held exclusively by one spouse usually stays with the spouse unless the other spouse is able to establish contribution or joint ownership. Jewellery and gifts that fall under the category of Stridhan are not divisible and stay with the wife.Jewellery Given by In-LawsJewels received from your in-laws are yours (Stridhan) and you are entitled to all rights over them, even after divorce. Your husband cannot ask for it unless proved that it was given or shared jointly or gifted to him.Practical Tips for Friendly SettlementAs your husband is seeking an amicable mutual divorce, negotiate clearly as follows:Keep all jewellery and gifts received by you.Leave out the furniture from the settlement if you do not wish to have it.Negotiate reasonable alimony or compensation according to your mental harassment and economic needs.Put all agreements on paper in the mutual divorce petition so that any future disputes can be avoided.You may also consult a lawyer to prepare a fair settlement agreement and protect your rights while going through the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Based on the facts presented, you are entitled to seek and negotiate a comprehensive settlement in amutual consent divorcethat accounts not only for your streedhan and marital contributions but also for the emotional and mental trauma you’ve endured over the course of your marriage. Under Indian law, all jewellery, valuables, and gifts received by you before, during, and after the marriage from your family form part of yourstreedhan— and you have an absolute legal right to reclaim the same, including any selective gifts you may wish to exclude such as furniture. Jewellery and valuables gifted by your in-laws, unless proven to be given jointly to both spouses, also fall under your personal entitlement. In amutual consent divorce, you may demand not just the return of streedhan but also a one-timelump sum alimony/settlementamount — in your case, you can justifiably seek Rs. 1 crore or higher, especially given the 14-year relationship, the betrayal, and the emotional suffering. While there is no strict formula under law for quantifying compensation in mutual divorce, it is entirely valid to raise such a demand, particularly when your husband is eager to dissolve the marriage swiftly and avoid litigation. You should ensure that all your terms — including return of jewellery, gifts, and financial compensation — are clearly recorded in a writtenMutual Divorce Settlement Agreementto be signed before filing the joint petition under Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act. You may also insert a clause in the agreement that ensures the full and final settlement is executed before the second motion of divorce, to protect your interests. It is advisable that you proceed through a lawyer to ensure your legal rights are protected in the drafting and execution of the agreement.

Without a registered agreement and explicit renewal terms, it is not enforceable beyond the initial 3-year period. A clause saying \"rent will rise annually by 10% after 3 years\" does not establish perpetual tenancy.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "answer": "Dear Client,Affidavit Language Issues The affidavit says you \"have neither used nor intend to use the services,\" suggesting the switch of service provider was your independent decision. This disregards the fact that you were compelled to switch because of their inability to produce documents. It also holds the service provider harmless for claims but fails to include any refund amount or express guarantee of refund payment. Presenting such an affidavit would dilute your legal stand and exonerate them from responsibility without ensuring your refund. Refund Rights and Contractual Obligations As you have paid INR 20,000 plus GST for a non-delivered service (because of their refusal of documents), you are entitled to a refund or compensation. Their insistence on an affidavit prior to refund seems to be an attempt to evade or delay refund. Unless the terms and conditions or the contract specifically demand such an affidavit, you are not required to provide it. Suggested Legal Course of Action Do not file the affidavit in its present form. Instead, ask for a written confirmation of the refund amount and duration in clear terms. If they deny or delay, issue a legal notice for refund of the amount paid on grounds of breach of contract and non-delivery of agreed services. Specify in the notice that you have the right to initiate consumer complaint proceedings for damages and recovery in case refund is not given immediately. Document all communications for evidence. Negotiation and Drafting Affidavit In case you wish to resolve amicably, negotiate affidavit terms clearly: Identifying the refund amount and date. Not waiving your rights or indemnifying them unjustly. Reflecting that the switch of service provider was on account of their default.

Indian courts can take jurisdiction if either of the parties is a resident or domiciled in India. She can approach the family court or the district court where she is living in India.2. Recognition of Foreign Marriages and DivorceMarriages and divorces registered outside India are usually accepted in India if registered at the Indian embassy or consulate or when the parties subsequently register the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.If the marriage was not registered in India, she may still get a divorce in India on the basis of the marriage certificate obtained in UAE or other proof of marriage. Divorce orders issued in UAE can be challenged or accepted in India based on procedural adherence and jurisdiction.3. Ground and Procedure for Divorce in IndiaIndian courts tend to sympathize with wives who approach them for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty or desertion, such as cases of conversion or fraudulent inducement4. UAE Court OptionsUAE courts follow Sharia law for Muslim marriages, and she can still approach them for divorce. Divorce in UAE is followed by mandatory attempts at reconciliation at the Family Guidance Section prior to court proceedings. If reconciliation does not work, the court goes ahead with divorce on evidence available.But even if she cannot get relief from UAE courts, filing in India is still an option5. Other Legal RemediesShe can also seek the legal support and advice of the Indian embassy or consulate in UAE. She can also seek assistance from NGOs or legal aid groups that help Indian women with matrimonial problems abroad.

    "question": "Deficiency of service",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Affidavit Language Issues The affidavit says you \"have neither used nor intend to use the services,\" suggesting the switch of service provider was your independent decision. This disregards the fact that you were compelled to switch because of their inability to produce documents. It also holds the service provider harmless for claims but fails to include any refund amount or express guarantee of refund payment. Presenting such an affidavit would dilute your legal stand and exonerate them from responsibility without ensuring your refund. Refund Rights and Contractual Obligations As you have paid INR 20,000 plus GST for a non-delivered service (because of their refusal of documents), you are entitled to a refund or compensation. Their insistence on an affidavit prior to refund seems to be an attempt to evade or delay refund. Unless the terms and conditions or the contract specifically demand such an affidavit, you are not required to provide it. Suggested Legal Course of Action Do not file the affidavit in its present form. Instead, ask for a written confirmation of the refund amount and duration in clear terms. If they deny or delay, issue a legal notice for refund of the amount paid on grounds of breach of contract and non-delivery of agreed services. Specify in the notice that you have the right to initiate consumer complaint proceedings for damages and recovery in case refund is not given immediately. Document all communications for evidence. Negotiation and Drafting Affidavit In case you wish to resolve amicably, negotiate affidavit terms clearly: Identifying the refund amount and date. Not waiving your rights or indemnifying them unjustly. Reflecting that the switch of service provider was on account of their default. Seek legal assistance to prepare or vet the affidavit prior to submission.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 30 days ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Wife asking in writing to come back",
    "answer": "Dear client,The following points are duly to be noted1. Demand for Maintenance by Your WifeAs no maintenance proceeding or court order is already existing, your wife's demand for ₹35,000 a month is not enforceable as of right. According to Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, a spouse is entitled to claim maintenance in proceedings for divorce or judicial separation, but in the absence of any such proceedings, there is no duty to pay monthly maintenance simply because she makes a demand. However, if you want to make amends, and if you wish to do that by providing reasonable financial assistance as a gesture of good faith you choose to do that , but is not legally enforceable unless so ordered by the court.2. Written Undertaking as to BehaviourYour wife requesting written guarantees that you will not physically assault or emotionally abuse her, even where there have been no previous incidents, is really a precautionary or confidence-building measure on her part. There is no statutory requirement to give such written statements unless there are complaints or allegations of cruelty ordomestic violence. If you truly wish to reconcile, giving a written undertaking of good behaviour can assist in the establishment of trust, but it is not statutory.3. Legal Framework for ReconciliationAccording to Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, where one of the spouses relinquishes the other's society without sufficient reason, the aggrieved spouse may make a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights, which is a judicial measure for re-establishment of cohabitation. Reconciliation and mediation are encouraged by courts before a divorce is granted, according to Section 23 of the Act and Family Courts Act provisions. If you do wish to reconcile, you can look at mediation or counselling to deal with the issues beneath.4. Your Rights and What to Do NextYou are not under any obligation at law to pay maintenance or give written undertakings except in the case of a court order or legal action. You can signal your desire to reconcile but state that any financial help or undertakings must be agreed between you and not sought unilaterally. If your wife demands terms that you think are unreasonable, you can seek legal counsel or mediation to iron out differences amicably. In case of failure to reconcile, either of the parties may seek divorce under grounds mentioned in theHindu Marriage Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife asking in writing to come back",
    "answer": "Dear client,The following points are duly to be noted1. Demand for Maintenance by Your WifeAs no maintenance proceeding or court order is already existing, your wife's demand for ₹35,000 a month is not enforceable as of right. According to Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, a spouse is entitled to claim maintenance in proceedings for divorce or judicial separation, but in the absence of any such proceedings, there is no duty to pay monthly maintenance simply because she makes a demand. However, if you want to make amends, and if you wish to do that by providing reasonable financial assistance as a gesture of good faith you choose to do that , but is not legally enforceable unless so ordered by the court.2. Written Undertaking as to BehaviourYour wife requesting written guarantees that you will not physically assault or emotionally abuse her, even where there have been no previous incidents, is really a precautionary or confidence-building measure on her part. There is no statutory requirement to give such written statements unless there are complaints or allegations of cruelty ordomestic violence. If you truly wish to reconcile, giving a written undertaking of good behaviour can assist in the establishment of trust, but it is not statutory.3. Legal Framework for ReconciliationAccording to Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, where one of the spouses relinquishes the other's society without sufficient reason, the aggrieved spouse may make a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights, which is a judicial measure for re-establishment of cohabitation. Reconciliation and mediation are encouraged by courts before a divorce is granted, according to Section 23 of the Act and Family Courts Act provisions. If you do wish to reconcile, you can look at mediation or counselling to deal with the issues beneath.4. Your Rights and What to Do NextYou are not under any obligation at law to pay maintenance or give written undertakings except in the case of a court order or legal action. You can signal your desire to reconcile but state that any financial help or undertakings must be agreed between you and not sought unilaterally. If your wife demands terms that you think are unreasonable, you can seek legal counsel or mediation to iron out differences amicably. In case of failure to reconcile, either of the parties may seek divorce under grounds mentioned in theHindu Marriage Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 30 days ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Wife asking in writing to come back",
    "answer": "Dear client,The following points are duly to be noted1. Demand for Maintenance by Your WifeAs no maintenance proceeding or court order is already existing, your wife's demand for ₹35,000 a month is not enforceable as of right. According to Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, a spouse is entitled to claim maintenance in proceedings for divorce or judicial separation, but in the absence of any such proceedings, there is no duty to pay monthly maintenance simply because she makes a demand. However, if you want to make amends, and if you wish to do that by providing reasonable financial assistance as a gesture of good faith you choose to do that , but is not legally enforceable unless so ordered by the court.2. Written Undertaking as to BehaviourYour wife requesting written guarantees that you will not physically assault or emotionally abuse her, even where there have been no previous incidents, is really a precautionary or confidence-building measure on her part. There is no statutory requirement to give such written statements unless there are complaints or allegations of cruelty ordomestic violence. If you truly wish to reconcile, giving a written undertaking of good behaviour can assist in the establishment of trust, but it is not statutory.3. Legal Framework for ReconciliationAccording to Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, where one of the spouses relinquishes the other's society without sufficient reason, the aggrieved spouse may make a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights, which is a judicial measure for re-establishment of cohabitation. Reconciliation and mediation are encouraged by courts before a divorce is granted, according to Section 23 of the Act and Family Courts Act provisions. If you do wish to reconcile, you can look at mediation or counselling to deal with the issues beneath.4. Your Rights and What to Do NextYou are not under any obligation at law to pay maintenance or give written undertakings except in the case of a court order or legal action. You can signal your desire to reconcile but state that any financial help or undertakings must be agreed between you and not sought unilaterally. If your wife demands terms that you think are unreasonable, you can seek legal counsel or mediation to iron out differences amicably. In case of failure to reconcile, either of the parties may seek divorce under grounds mentioned in theHindu Marriage Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the tenant has committed wilful default in payment of monthly rental amount continuously for two months or more then you can issue a legal notice to him instructing him to vacate and deliver vacant possession by giving him 60 days time to do so. The reason for eviction can affect the notice period, with breaches of the lease agreement potentially leading to shorter notice periods.It may be noted  that if the tenant committed wilful default in payment of rent, for thetwo consecutive months, then the landlord is entitled to issue an eviction notice giving him time to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession.Failing to comply with the demands made, the landlord can file an eviction suit.The time taken for disposal of eviction suit cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it and it may take more than two years also.You can give a power of attorney deed in favor of your close relative in India to conduct the case on your behalf.The litigation expenses and the lawyer's fee will be intimated by the lawyer who you may be engaging for this purpose.Money recovery suit can be filed separately for the money you have lent to the tenant on the basis of the documentary evidences for proving the money transactions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

Indian courts can take jurisdiction if either of the parties is a resident or domiciled in India. She can approach the family court or the district court where she is living in India.2. Recognition of Foreign Marriages and DivorceMarriages and divorces registered outside India are usually accepted in India if registered at the Indian embassy or consulate or when the parties subsequently register the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.If the marriage was not registered in India, she may still get a divorce in India on the basis of the marriage certificate obtained in UAE or other proof of marriage. Divorce orders issued in UAE can be challenged or accepted in India based on procedural adherence and jurisdiction.3. Ground and Procedure for Divorce in IndiaIndian courts tend to sympathize with wives who approach them for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty or desertion, such as cases of conversion or fraudulent inducement4. UAE Court OptionsUAE courts follow Sharia law for Muslim marriages, and she can still approach them for divorce. Divorce in UAE is followed by mandatory attempts at reconciliation at the Family Guidance Section prior to court proceedings. If reconciliation does not work, the court goes ahead with divorce on evidence available.But even if she cannot get relief from UAE courts, filing in India is still an option5. Other Legal RemediesShe can also seek the legal support and advice of the Indian embassy or consulate in UAE. She can also seek assistance from NGOs or legal aid groups that help Indian women with matrimonial problems abroad. If there is any aspect of fraud or coercion involved in the marriage or conversion, she can bring these matters before Indian courts tooAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Eviction of tenant",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, even if there is an unregistered agreement, you may serve legal notice and eviction proceedings as an owner on grounds of misuse of possession, non-payment of rent, and term expiry.The tenant cannot legally withhold rent during proceedings; withholding rent may invalidate their case and further consolidate grounds for eviction.The renewal clause does not mean automatic or perpetual extension. Without a registered agreement and explicit renewal terms, it is not enforceable beyond the initial 3-year period. A clause saying \"rent will rise annually by 10% after 3 years\" does not establish perpetual tenancy.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "answer": "If the tenant has committed wilful default in payment of monthly rental amount continuously for two months or more then you can issue a legal notice to him instructing him to vacate and deliver vacant possession by giving him 60 days time to do so. The reason for eviction can affect the notice period, with breaches of the lease agreement potentially leading to shorter notice periods.It may be noted  that if the tenant committed wilful default in payment of rent, for thetwo consecutive months, then the landlord is entitled to issue an eviction notice giving him time to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession.Failing to comply with the demands made, the landlord can file an eviction suit.The time taken for disposal of eviction suit cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it and it may take more than two years also.You can give a power of attorney deed in favor of your close relative in India to conduct the case on your behalf.The litigation expenses and the lawyer's fee will be intimated by the lawyer who you may be engaging for this purpose.Money recovery suit can be filed separately for the money you have lent to the tenant on the basis of the documentary evidences for proving the money transactions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "question": "How to get separated in interfaith marriage done in UAE by a Hindu girl",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Jurisdiction and Filing of Divorce in IndiaShe can present a divorce case in India subject to the relative personal law to which her marriage is governed. Indian courts can take jurisdiction if either of the parties is a resident or domiciled in India. She can approach the family court or the district court where she is living in India.2. Recognition of Foreign Marriages and DivorceMarriages and divorces registered outside India are usually accepted in India if registered at the Indian embassy or consulate or when the parties subsequently register the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.If the marriage was not registered in India, she may still get a divorce in India on the basis of the marriage certificate obtained in UAE or other proof of marriage. Divorce orders issued in UAE can be challenged or accepted in India based on procedural adherence and jurisdiction.3. Ground and Procedure for Divorce in IndiaIndian courts tend to sympathize with wives who approach them for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty or desertion, such as cases of conversion or fraudulent inducement4. UAE Court OptionsUAE courts follow Sharia law for Muslim marriages, and she can still approach them for divorce. Divorce in UAE is followed by mandatory attempts at reconciliation at the Family Guidance Section prior to court proceedings. If reconciliation does not work, the court goes ahead with divorce on evidence available.But even if she cannot get relief from UAE courts, filing in India is still an option5. Other Legal RemediesShe can also seek the legal support and advice of the Indian embassy or consulate in UAE. She can also seek assistance from NGOs or legal aid groups that help Indian women with matrimonial problems abroad. If there is any aspect of fraud or coercion involved in the marriage or conversion, she can bring these matters before Indian courts tooAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, this is typically done under certain circumstances, such as when the developer wishes to create separate societies for each building or wing within a layout. The promoter would need to form and register a separate co-operative society for each building, and then form an Apex Body or Federation to manage common areas and facilities.In your case there is a status quo order by high court hence you cannot get your building out of the condominium until the disposal of the case.The members if not having a registered sale deed on their names then they cannot be included as a member into the society.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "question": "False pocso case linked to principal position dispute",
    "answer": "1. How are you related to the case, are you an accused?If not the accused only has to file an application for recall of the witness based on the documents he may rely upon to defend his interests, you can inform your advocate.The party seeking to recall the witness must file an application under section 311  with the court, stating the reasons for the recall and why the witness's further examination is essential for a just decision.The court has the discretion to grant or deny the application based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court must consider whether the witness's testimony is essential for the just decision and whether it is being sought to fill in gaps in the case.2. If a cross-examination is halted and the witness doesn't return, the party attempting cross-examination may move to have the witness recalled or, depending on the circumstances and applicable laws, the witness's testimony may be considered incomplete or withdrawn. In criminal cases, the court may draw adverse inferences from the lack of cross-examination.3. The accused has the right to inspect the evidence during cross-examination. This right is crucial for the accused to defend themselves adequately by challenging the credibility of witnesses and testing the veracity of their statements.4. If the accused proves a false accusation during the trial, the court should direct the police to register a case under Section 22 of the POCSO Act and proceed accordingly5. When a victim turns 18, the case is no longer considered a juvenile case under the Juvenile Justice Act. The POCSO Act remains applicable, but the proceedings may shift to the adult courts. False allegations under thePOCSO Actpresent a significant challenge to the justice system. While the Act is crucial for safeguarding children from sexual offenses, its stringent provisions can be misused by individuals with malicious intent.6. If a witness fails to appear for cross-examination after three scheduled dates, the court can take various actions, including issuing a warrant of arrest, imposing a fine, or ordering the witness's property to be sold. The court may also consider the witness's testimony to be invalid, and the case may proceed without their testimony.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Jurisdiction and Filing of Divorce in IndiaShe can present a divorce case in India subject to the relative personal law to which her marriage is governed. Indian courts can take jurisdiction if either of the parties is a resident or domiciled in India. She can approach the family court or the district court where she is living in India.2. Recognition of Foreign Marriages and DivorceMarriages and divorces registered outside India are usually accepted in India if registered at the Indian embassy or consulate or when the parties subsequently register the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.If the marriage was not registered in India, she may still get a divorce in India on the basis of the marriage certificate obtained in UAE or other proof of marriage. Divorce orders issued in UAE can be challenged or accepted in India based on procedural adherence and jurisdiction.3. Ground and Procedure for Divorce in IndiaIndian courts tend to sympathize with wives who approach them for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty or desertion, such as cases of conversion or fraudulent inducement4. UAE Court OptionsUAE courts follow Sharia law for Muslim marriages, and she can still approach them for divorce. Divorce in UAE is followed by mandatory attempts at reconciliation at the Family Guidance Section prior to court proceedings. If reconciliation does not work, the court goes ahead with divorce on evidence available.But even if she cannot get relief from UAE courts, filing in India is still an option5. Other Legal RemediesShe can also seek the legal support and advice of the Indian embassy or consulate in UAE. She can also seek assistance from NGOs or legal aid groups that help Indian women with matrimonial problems abroad. If there is any aspect of fraud or coercion involved in the marriage or conversion, she can bring these matters before Indian courts tooAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "answer": "1. How are you related to the case, are you an accused?If not the accused only has to file an application for recall of the witness based on the documents he may rely upon to defend his interests, you can inform your advocate.The party seeking to recall the witness must file an application under section 311  with the court, stating the reasons for the recall and why the witness's further examination is essential for a just decision.The court has the discretion to grant or deny the application based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court must consider whether the witness's testimony is essential for the just decision and whether it is being sought to fill in gaps in the case.2. If a cross-examination is halted and the witness doesn't return, the party attempting cross-examination may move to have the witness recalled or, depending on the circumstances and applicable laws, the witness's testimony may be considered incomplete or withdrawn. In criminal cases, the court may draw adverse inferences from the lack of cross-examination.3. The accused has the right to inspect the evidence during cross-examination. This right is crucial for the accused to defend themselves adequately by challenging the credibility of witnesses and testing the veracity of their statements.4. If the accused proves a false accusation during the trial, the court should direct the police to register a case under Section 22 of the POCSO Act and proceed accordingly5. When a victim turns 18, the case is no longer considered a juvenile case under the Juvenile Justice Act. The POCSO Act remains applicable, but the proceedings may shift to the adult courts. False allegations under thePOCSO Actpresent a significant challenge to the justice system. While the Act is crucial for safeguarding children from sexual offenses, its stringent provisions can be misused by individuals with malicious intent.6. If a witness fails to appear for cross-examination after three scheduled dates, the court can take various actions, including issuing a warrant of arrest, imposing a fine, or ordering the witness's property to be sold. The court may also consider the witness's testimony to be invalid, and the case may proceed without their testimony.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "If the tenant has committed wilful default in payment of monthly rental amount continuously for two months or more then you can issue a legal notice to him instructing him to vacate and deliver vacant possession by giving him 60 days time to do so. The reason for eviction can affect the notice period, with breaches of the lease agreement potentially leading to shorter notice periods.It may be noted  that if the tenant committed wilful default in payment of rent, for thetwo consecutive months, then the landlord is entitled to issue an eviction notice giving him time to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession.Failing to comply with the demands made, the landlord can file an eviction suit.The time taken for disposal of eviction suit cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it and it may take more than two years also.You can give a power of attorney deed in favor of your close relative in India to conduct the case on your behalf.The litigation expenses and the lawyer's fee will be intimated by the lawyer who you may be engaging for this purpose.Money recovery suit can be filed separately for the money you have lent to the tenant on the basis of the documentary evidences for proving the money transactions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "answer": "If the tenant has committed wilful default in payment of monthly rental amount continuously for two months or more then you can issue a legal notice to him instructing him to vacate and deliver vacant possession by giving him 60 days time to do so. The reason for eviction can affect the notice period, with breaches of the lease agreement potentially leading to shorter notice periods.It may be noted  that if the tenant committed wilful default in payment of rent, for thetwo consecutive months, then the landlord is entitled to issue an eviction notice giving him time to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession.Failing to comply with the demands made, the landlord can file an eviction suit.The time taken for disposal of eviction suit cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it and it may take more than two years also.You can give a power of attorney deed in favor of your close relative in India to conduct the case on your behalf.The litigation expenses and the lawyer's fee will be intimated by the lawyer who you may be engaging for this purpose.Money recovery suit can be filed separately for the money you have lent to the tenant on the basis of the documentary evidences for proving the money transactions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "answer": "You are in a crucial phase of your employment, especially being just two months away from completing five years of continuous service, which would make you eligible for gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. If the company is forcing you to resign now, you must firmly assert that any resignation or relieving should be aligned in a way that your last working day falls after completing five years, i.e., post 6th October 2025, to ensure your gratuity entitlement is not lost. You can negotiate on the grounds that you have served the company diligently for 4.5 years, received a promotion and yearly increments, and are currently in the process of seeking alternate employment. Politely but firmly convey that you are willing to serve the notice period or work from home until your five-year service is completed, after which you will resign or accept separation. If pressured, you can also point out the discriminatory nature of the layoff process, where high-paid executives close to the management are being protected, while others are being asked to leave arbitrarily. While keeping your tone professional and non-confrontational, you may also suggest that the company offers a deferred relieving date or issues a continuation certificate to reflect full five years of service, ensuring you do not lose out on statutory benefits or future job prospects.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "You are in a crucial phase of your employment, especially being just two months away from completing five years of continuous service, which would make you eligible for gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. If the company is forcing you to resign now, you must firmly assert that any resignation or relieving should be aligned in a way that your last working day falls after completing five years, i.e., post 6th October 2025, to ensure your gratuity entitlement is not lost. You can negotiate on the grounds that you have served the company diligently for 4.5 years, received a promotion and yearly increments, and are currently in the process of seeking alternate employment. Politely but firmly convey that you are willing to serve the notice period or work from home until your five-year service is completed, after which you will resign or accept separation. If pressured, you can also point out the discriminatory nature of the layoff process, where high-paid executives close to the management are being protected, while others are being asked to leave arbitrarily. While keeping your tone professional and non-confrontational, you may also suggest that the company offers a deferred relieving date or issues a continuation certificate to reflect full five years of service, ensuring you do not lose out on statutory benefits or future job prospects.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "question": "TDS for NRI",
    "answer": "As an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) selling a property in Bangalore at a capital loss, you are still subject to TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, as the obligation to deduct TDS applies regardless of whether the sale results in a gain or loss. However, since there is no actual gain, you can apply for a NIL or lower TDS certificate from the Income Tax Department by filing Form 13 online—this certificate, once issued, allows the buyer to deduct TDS at a lower rate (even zero, if approved). To proceed, it is mandatory for you to obtain a PAN card, which is required both for applying for the certificate and for filing your Income Tax Return in case of any refund claim. Once you have the PAN and the certificate, the buyer will also need to file Form 15CA and, if necessary, Form 15CB (issued by a Chartered Accountant) before remitting the sale proceeds to you. If TDS is deducted despite the loss, you can file a return at the end of the financial year to claim a refund. In short, your first step should be to apply for a PAN card, followed by seeking the NIL TDS certificate, which will help avoid unnecessary deduction on a loss-making transaction.Let me know if you’d like assistance with the PAN or Form 13 process.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "question": "Injunction, court vacations, no written arguments, what to do next?",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,According to the existing law and judicial practice in Karnataka, the following are elaborate answers to your questions concerning your child custody case pending before the Family Court, Bangalore:1. If you receive a negative order on 23rd April 2025, when can you move the High Court for a stay? Do you have to wait until June 1st when courts resume or can you move the vacation bench?Right to Appeal and Stay:You are entitled to appeal the Family Court's order to the Karnataka High Court. Appeals in family cases such as custody are normally heard early in view of the sensitive nature entailing the well-being of a child.Vacation Bench Availability:Given the case at hand, you need not wait until June 1st when regular courts resume. You can instead choose to approach the vacation bench immediately after the order is delivered with a petition for stay or interim relief.Practical Steps to be taken :File the appeal and stay application at the earliest after the judgement.Seek the urgent listing prior to vacation bench on grounds of welfare of the child and after elaborating the issues of injunction .The courts usually give priority to such cases during vacations to avoid irreparable injury to the parties of the case.2. If the existing injunction against removal of the child from Bangalore is vacated, can your wife relocate the child to her hometown and enroll the child in school by June? How simple will it be to bring the child back?Effect of Vacating Injunction: If the Family Court quashes the injunction restraining removal of the child from Bangalore jurisdiction, by law your wife can move the child to her hometown.Admission to School: As mentioned after moving from Bangalore, she can further choose to enroll the child in a school there by June, as the school admission is normally on the basis of residence and guardianship.Difficulty in Bringing Child Back: It can be difficult and legally tricky to bring the child back to Bangalore after relocation. The custody orders and the child's ordinary residence are considered very crucial. You might be in a position to file a new custody petition in the new jurisdiction or file for modification of custody orders, which can be time-consuming and emotionally draining after relocation of the child3. Is it a good idea to file written arguments on the next hearing date?It is a cautious approach, particularly in sensitive cases with regard to that of child custody. Filing the written argument can be beneficial as it helps to:Present your legal and factual arguments clearly.The judge may also appreciate your side of the case fully.Maintaining the record of your submissions, which is useful in appeals or review.Improve your case and provides a positive impression on the recordTiming:As the court has listed the case for orders and no written arguments have been filed so far, filing well-written written arguments on the next date or even prior to the vacation period can positively affect the court's decision.Other Legal ConsiderationsThe courts give precedence to the child's best interest and welfare over everything else in custody cases. The Courts commonly grant interim custody or visitation rights balancing the interests of both parents, particularly during pendency of final orders.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "For the lost original title documents you will have to lodge a FIR with police and also publish a public notice in 2 local newspapers one in English and one in MarathiAs regards the second requisition, if the wife and child are not traceable then you will have to file a declaratory suit against them and obtain a declaration from the court that after the demise of husband his widow and child were the only surviving legal heirs of the husband and that both had consented for transfer of the husband's share in the flat to the name of wife (the minor would have given such consent upon attaining majority)From your query it is clear that your title is defective and is not marketableThe bank's requisitions are reasonable. First try to convince the bank by making an affidavit with indemnity so far the requisition of submitting the noc of the widow and child for transfer of husband's share to the wife's name, is concerned. If the bank does not agree then you would have to request the buyer to find another lender which would be flexible with the said requisition or which would dispense with it altogetherOr else you will have to find a buyer who is not financed by a bankAtleast for now you can do the first step as regards the lost documents as stated aboveYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

However, since no such record exists, you need to fix this issue now.📌Steps to Resolve:✅Contact the Wife & Son (If Traceable):Since you have managed to locate their contacts,request them to execute a Legal Heir Affidavit & No-Objection Certificate (NOC)confirming that:The husband passed away.The wife was the legal heir.The son hasno objectionto past property transactions.✅If the Son is Untraceable or Unwilling:Execute aFresh Indemnity Bondstating that:The transaction was done in good faith.There were no disputes when the property was transferred.The share certificate was transferred as per standard practice in the society.📌How I Can Help:✅Draft the Legal Heir Affidavit & No-Objection Certificate (NOC)if the wife and son are available.✅Draft a New Indemnity Bond & Declarationto protect you legally if the legal heir refuses to cooperate.3️⃣ Issue with \"Chuk Durusti Patra\" (Correction Deed) in 2004✔ Since anagreement was registered in 2004 but later canceled, and acancellation deed was executed, the issue here iswhether the correction is legally recorded properly.📌Steps to Resolve:✅Verify if the Cancellation Deed was Registered:Obtain a certified copy of the cancellation deed from theSub-Registrar’s Office (SRO).Ensure that the agreement cancellation isproperly recorded in property records.✅Clarify the \"Chuk Durusti Patra\" Entry:\"Chuk Durusti Patra\" meansCorrection Deedin Marathi. This should not cause an issueif it correctly reflects the canceled transaction.If there’s a discrepancy, file anApplication for Rectificationat the Sub-Registrar’s Office.📌How I Can Help:✅Obtain & Review the Cancellation Deedto check for errors.✅Prepare a Rectification Applicationif needed.🔹 How I Can Assist You & Ensure a Smooth Property Sale📌Legal Drafting Services (Cost-Effective for You)✔Draft Indemnity Bond & Affidavit for Lost Documents(For bank loan approval).✔Draft Legal Heir Affidavit & NOC from Wife & Son(To complete missing records).✔Prepare Indemnity Bond (If Son is Unwilling to Cooperate).✔Assist with Newspaper Notice & FIR for Missing Documents.✔Verify & Rectify \"Chuk Durusti Patra\" Issue.🔹How This Saves You Money:✅ Instead of hiring a law firm in Mumbai at high fees, you get professionally drafted documentsdirectly from me.✅ You only need a local notary or advocate forminor filings, which costs much less.✅ Ensuresfaster loan approval & smooth property sale, avoidingdelays & buyer loss.📞Let’s connect now to draft all required legal documents and complete the process efficiently!🚀Contact/WhatsApp No -  Zero Zero Zero Six EightSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "answer": "To ensure a smooth sale of your CHS flat and meet the bank’s documentation requirements, follow these steps:1. Loss of Documents Procedure for Missing Original Agreements (1985 & 1992)Since the original sale agreements (1985 & 1992) are lost or unavailable, the following process must be undertaken:Steps to Obtain Legal Confirmation of Lost Documents:Lodge a Police Complaint (FIR or NC Report)File a missing document report at the local police station mentioning the details of the lost agreements.Obtain a copy of the FIR or Non-Cognizable (NC) report for record-keeping.Issue a Public Notice in NewspapersPublish a notice in two newspapers (one English and one vernacular) stating that the documents have been lost.Include details such as property address, transaction years, and request for any claimants to come forward within 15 days.Prepare an Affidavit and Indemnity BondDraft anAffidavitdeclaring the loss of documents and stating that they are not pledged or misused.Prepare anIndemnity Bondindemnifying the buyer and the bank against any future claims related to the missing agreements.Notarise these documents.Certified Copies from the Sub-Registrar OfficeApply for certified copies of the lost sale agreements from thelocal Sub-Registrar officewhere they were originally registered.If they were unregistered, obtaining copies may not be possible, and reliance will be on newspaper notice, FIR, and indemnity bond.2. Affidavit/Declaration by Legal Heirs of Husband for 1997 Share TransferSince there is no record of legal heirs signing an affidavit for the 1997 share transfer from Husband & Wife to Wife alone, the following can be done:Affidavit by Wife (Now Deceased) or Heirs of Husband (If Living)If the wife is still alive, she can execute an affidavit stating that as the sole legal heir (along with the minor child), she received the share transfer from her late husband in 1997.If she is deceased, her legal heirs (including the child, now an adult) can execute afresh affidavitconfirming no objections to past transactions.Indemnity BondThe current owners (your family) can execute anIndemnity Bondstating that the property was acquired in good faith and no claims exist from the husband's heirs.Society Confirmation LetterRequest the society to issue a letter confirming that the share certificate was duly transferred in 1997, and no objections were raised.3. Ensuring Clear Documentation for Future BuyersCompile and Notarise all Affidavits & Indemnity Bondsto avoid any future complications.Obtain Encumbrance Certificate (EC) from the Sub-Registrar Officeto confirm no legal issues.Ensure Proper Chain of Title– Certified copies of the 1985 & 1992 agreements and the 2005 sale agreement should be documented properly.Update Society Records– Request the society to issue a no-dues and title confirmation letter.By following these steps, the property title will be legally secure, and banks will process loan approvals smoothly.If you require professional assistance in drafting the legal documents, feel free to get in touch.Thanks and Regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "For the lost original title documents you will have to lodge a FIR with police and also publish a public notice in 2 local newspapers one in English and one in MarathiAs regards the second requisition, if the wife and child are not traceable then you will have to file a declaratory suit against them and obtain a declaration from the court that after the demise of husband his widow and child were the only surviving legal heirs of the husband and that both had consented for transfer of the husband's share in the flat to the name of wife (the minor would have given such consent upon attaining majority)From your query it is clear that your title is defective and is not marketableThe bank's requisitions are reasonable. First try to convince the bank by making an affidavit with indemnity so far the requisition of submitting the noc of the widow and child for transfer of husband's share to the wife's name, is concerned. If the bank does not agree then you would have to request the buyer to find another lender which would be flexible with the said requisition or which would dispense with it altogetherOr else you will have to find a buyer who is not financed by a bankAtleast for now you can do the first step as regards the lost documents as stated aboveYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

However, since no such record exists, you need to fix this issue now.📌Steps to Resolve:✅Contact the Wife & Son (If Traceable):Since you have managed to locate their contacts,request them to execute a Legal Heir Affidavit & No-Objection Certificate (NOC)confirming that:The husband passed away.The wife was the legal heir.The son hasno objectionto past property transactions.✅If the Son is Untraceable or Unwilling:Execute aFresh Indemnity Bondstating that:The transaction was done in good faith.There were no disputes when the property was transferred.The share certificate was transferred as per standard practice in the society.📌How I Can Help:✅Draft the Legal Heir Affidavit & No-Objection Certificate (NOC)if the wife and son are available.✅Draft a New Indemnity Bond & Declarationto protect you legally if the legal heir refuses to cooperate.3️⃣ Issue with \"Chuk Durusti Patra\" (Correction Deed) in 2004✔ Since anagreement was registered in 2004 but later canceled, and acancellation deed was executed, the issue here iswhether the correction is legally recorded properly.📌Steps to Resolve:✅Verify if the Cancellation Deed was Registered:Obtain a certified copy of the cancellation deed from theSub-Registrar’s Office (SRO).Ensure that the agreement cancellation isproperly recorded in property records.✅Clarify the \"Chuk Durusti Patra\" Entry:\"Chuk Durusti Patra\" meansCorrection Deedin Marathi. This should not cause an issueif it correctly reflects the canceled transaction.If there’s a discrepancy, file anApplication for Rectificationat the Sub-Registrar’s Office.📌How I Can Help:✅Obtain & Review the Cancellation Deedto check for errors.✅Prepare a Rectification Applicationif needed.🔹 How I Can Assist You & Ensure a Smooth Property Sale📌Legal Drafting Services (Cost-Effective for You)✔Draft Indemnity Bond & Affidavit for Lost Documents(For bank loan approval).✔Draft Legal Heir Affidavit & NOC from Wife & Son(To complete missing records).✔Prepare Indemnity Bond (If Son is Unwilling to Cooperate).✔Assist with Newspaper Notice & FIR for Missing Documents.✔Verify & Rectify \"Chuk Durusti Patra\" Issue.🔹How This Saves You Money:✅ Instead of hiring a law firm in Mumbai at high fees, you get professionally drafted documentsdirectly from me.✅ You only need a local notary or advocate forminor filings, which costs much less.✅ Ensuresfaster loan approval & smooth property sale, avoidingdelays & buyer loss.📞Let’s connect now to draft all required legal documents and complete the process efficiently!🚀Contact/WhatsApp No -  Zero Zero Zero Six EightSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "answer": "To ensure a smooth sale of your CHS flat and meet the bank’s documentation requirements, follow these steps:1. Loss of Documents Procedure for Missing Original Agreements (1985 & 1992)Since the original sale agreements (1985 & 1992) are lost or unavailable, the following process must be undertaken:Steps to Obtain Legal Confirmation of Lost Documents:Lodge a Police Complaint (FIR or NC Report)File a missing document report at the local police station mentioning the details of the lost agreements.Obtain a copy of the FIR or Non-Cognizable (NC) report for record-keeping.Issue a Public Notice in NewspapersPublish a notice in two newspapers (one English and one vernacular) stating that the documents have been lost.Include details such as property address, transaction years, and request for any claimants to come forward within 15 days.Prepare an Affidavit and Indemnity BondDraft anAffidavitdeclaring the loss of documents and stating that they are not pledged or misused.Prepare anIndemnity Bondindemnifying the buyer and the bank against any future claims related to the missing agreements.Notarise these documents.Certified Copies from the Sub-Registrar OfficeApply for certified copies of the lost sale agreements from thelocal Sub-Registrar officewhere they were originally registered.If they were unregistered, obtaining copies may not be possible, and reliance will be on newspaper notice, FIR, and indemnity bond.2. Affidavit/Declaration by Legal Heirs of Husband for 1997 Share TransferSince there is no record of legal heirs signing an affidavit for the 1997 share transfer from Husband & Wife to Wife alone, the following can be done:Affidavit by Wife (Now Deceased) or Heirs of Husband (If Living)If the wife is still alive, she can execute an affidavit stating that as the sole legal heir (along with the minor child), she received the share transfer from her late husband in 1997.If she is deceased, her legal heirs (including the child, now an adult) can execute afresh affidavitconfirming no objections to past transactions.Indemnity BondThe current owners (your family) can execute anIndemnity Bondstating that the property was acquired in good faith and no claims exist from the husband's heirs.Society Confirmation LetterRequest the society to issue a letter confirming that the share certificate was duly transferred in 1997, and no objections were raised.3. Ensuring Clear Documentation for Future BuyersCompile and Notarise all Affidavits & Indemnity Bondsto avoid any future complications.Obtain Encumbrance Certificate (EC) from the Sub-Registrar Officeto confirm no legal issues.Ensure Proper Chain of Title– Certified copies of the 1985 & 1992 agreements and the 2005 sale agreement should be documented properly.Update Society Records– Request the society to issue a no-dues and title confirmation letter.By following these steps, the property title will be legally secure, and banks will process loan approvals smoothly.If you require professional assistance in drafting the legal documents, feel free to get in touch.Thanks and Regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "question": "TDS for NRI",
    "answer": "As an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) selling a property in Bangalore at a capital loss, you are still subject to TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, as the obligation to deduct TDS applies regardless of whether the sale results in a gain or loss. However, since there is no actual gain, you can apply for a NIL or lower TDS certificate from the Income Tax Department by filing Form 13 online—this certificate, once issued, allows the buyer to deduct TDS at a lower rate (even zero, if approved). To proceed, it is mandatory for you to obtain a PAN card, which is required both for applying for the certificate and for filing your Income Tax Return in case of any refund claim. Once you have the PAN and the certificate, the buyer will also need to file Form 15CA and, if necessary, Form 15CB (issued by a Chartered Accountant) before remitting the sale proceeds to you. If TDS is deducted despite the loss, you can file a return at the end of the financial year to claim a refund. In short, your first step should be to apply for a PAN card, followed by seeking the NIL TDS certificate, which will help avoid unnecessary deduction on a loss-making transaction.Let me know if you’d like assistance with the PAN or Form 13 process.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "You are in a crucial phase of your employment, especially being just two months away from completing five years of continuous service, which would make you eligible for gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. If the company is forcing you to resign now, you must firmly assert that any resignation or relieving should be aligned in a way that your last working day falls after completing five years, i.e., post 6th October 2025, to ensure your gratuity entitlement is not lost.

    "question": "TDS for NRI",
    "answer": "As an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) selling a property in Bangalore at a capital loss, you are still subject to TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, as the obligation to deduct TDS applies regardless of whether the sale results in a gain or loss. However, since there is no actual gain, you can apply for a NIL or lower TDS certificate from the Income Tax Department by filing Form 13 online—this certificate, once issued, allows the buyer to deduct TDS at a lower rate (even zero, if approved). To proceed, it is mandatory for you to obtain a PAN card, which is required both for applying for the certificate and for filing your Income Tax Return in case of any refund claim. Once you have the PAN and the certificate, the buyer will also need to file Form 15CA and, if necessary, Form 15CB (issued by a Chartered Accountant) before remitting the sale proceeds to you. If TDS is deducted despite the loss, you can file a return at the end of the financial year to claim a refund. In short, your first step should be to apply for a PAN card, followed by seeking the NIL TDS certificate, which will help avoid unnecessary deduction on a loss-making transaction.Let me know if you’d like assistance with the PAN or Form 13 process.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "question": "My parents properties are in different state and ID address as well. Can I get legal heirship coz I live in other state now?",
    "answer": "Dear sir,The course of action to be followed is given below1. Legal Ground for Property TransferRights of Ownership: According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, amended in 2005, all children (including daughters) are equally entitled to ancestral property. Because your father's plots were jointly held in your mother's name, on her passing away in 2022, her share automatically goes to all four legal heirs (you and your three sisters). The legal heir certificate that is issued by the Tehsil (mentioning your mother and four children) is considered as a valid document is considered sufficient in proving your status as legal heirs. The Tehsil cannot further choose to refuse this on grounds without providing any proper legal justification.2. Tehsil's Refusal: Addressing Their ConcernsThe Tehsil's denial on the grounds of your non-residence and absence of local address evidence is not legally sustainable. Mutation and property transfer are based on rights of ownership, not residence. Procedural obstacles can be overcome as follows:Steps to Overcome Tehsil's Objections:File Relinquishment Deeds from Sisters:As your sisters are married but agree, they need to sign registered relinquishment deeds (on stamp paper) specifically handing over their share in their favour.  This is a required under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.The following are the documents are required:The relinquishment deeds with the signatures of sisters and two witnesses.Sisters' notarized affidavits asserting their agreement.A Copy of the legal heir certificate and the death certificates of your parents.It is recommended to provide the ID proof such as the Aadhaar, PAN, or Voter ID (even with non-local addresses)It is also further recommended to take an affidavit stating the reason why the family shifted out in 2014 and submit the relevant reasons (e.g., work, studies) to avoid confusion.Affidavits of neighbours/relatives in the original area attesting to your family's ownership and your identity can serve as witness statements.Make a written application (through your lawyer) requesting the Tehsil to carry out a field inquiry to confirm the historical ownership records and the testimonies of local people (e.g. neighbours, ex-tenants).3. Legal Remedies if Tehsil Continues in RefusalIf the Tehsil still refuses the mutation , in such cases:Option 1: File a Revision PetitionProceed to Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) under Section 210 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, opposing the inaction of the Tehsil.Option 2: File a Writ Petition in the High CourtFile a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court for a writ of mandamus (to direct the Tehsil to apply the mutation).4. The important Documents required include the following:Legal heir certificate ( mentioning the mother and four children in it).The Death certificates of the parents.Both the sisters' relinquishment deeds (registered).Respective affidavits of non-residence and the witness statements.The Title deeds to the property (in mother's name).Provide for the indemnity bond (if it is being required by the Tehsil).5. The Practical Tips which may be necessary.Recommended to hire a Local Lawyer: A local lawyer can handle the case at hand with the Tehsil, it would help to speed up the field verification. The lawyer can also appear for you at hearings.To file a Grievance Online: Utilize the government portal (upbhulekh.gov.in) to raise a complaint or check mutation status of the property at hand.Take advantage of the Legal Heir Certificate: It is important to highlight that this certificate serves as a valid evidence of inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) selling a property in Bangalore at a capital loss, you are still subject to TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, as the obligation to deduct TDS applies regardless of whether the sale results in a gain or loss. However, since there is no actual gain, you can apply for a NIL or lower TDS certificate from the Income Tax Department by filing Form 13 online—this certificate, once issued, allows the buyer to deduct TDS at a lower rate (even zero, if approved). To proceed, it is mandatory for you to obtain a PAN card, which is required both for applying for the certificate and for filing your Income Tax Return in case of any refund claim. Once you have the PAN and the certificate, the buyer will also need to file Form 15CA and, if necessary, Form 15CB (issued by a Chartered Accountant) before remitting the sale proceeds to you. If TDS is deducted despite the loss, you can file a return at the end of the financial year to claim a refund. In short, your first step should be to apply for a PAN card, followed by seeking the NIL TDS certificate, which will help avoid unnecessary deduction on a loss-making transaction.Let me know if you’d like assistance with the PAN or Form 13 process.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "You are in a crucial phase of your employment, especially being just two months away from completing five years of continuous service, which would make you eligible for gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. If the company is forcing you to resign now, you must firmly assert that any resignation or relieving should be aligned in a way that your last working day falls after completing five years, i.e., post 6th October 2025, to ensure your gratuity entitlement is not lost. You can negotiate on the grounds that you have served the company diligently for 4.5 years, received a promotion and yearly increments, and are currently in the process of seeking alternate employment. Politely but firmly convey that you are willing to serve the notice period or work from home until your five-year service is completed, after which you will resign or accept separation. If pressured, you can also point out the discriminatory nature of the layoff process, where high-paid executives close to the management are being protected, while others are being asked to leave arbitrarily. While keeping your tone professional and non-confrontational, you may also suggest that the company offers a deferred relieving date or issues a continuation certificate to reflect full five years of service, ensuring you do not lose out on statutory benefits or future job prospects.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "question": "Hospital forcing discharge of paying bedridden terminal patient",
    "answer": "According to the Indian law and patient rights , a hospital cannot forcibly discharge or detain a patient against the patient's or their authorized family members' will, particularly when the basic charges are being paid and the patient or family wants to continue care or postpone discharge in particular. The \"comfort-care-only\" form you signed upholds your right to refuse aggressive treatments such as strong antibiotics, and the hospital has to honor this informed decision without coercion.Can the hospital discharge your father over your objection?The hospital cannot discharge him unilaterally just because you didn't want some treatments, particularly if he remains medically stable and basic payments are being met.If the hospital does insist on the discharge of the patient, they have to provide a \"dignified transfer\" with continuity of care, either in the patient's home or in an another facility.The hospital's argument that untreated infection can harm others does not warrant forced discharge without due medical evidence or alternative arrangements.How do you prevent or delay discharge legally?Write clearly in an email or letter your willingness to pay all the basic charges and your request for continued admission for at least 1–2 weeks to arrange care.If the hospital goes ahead with enforced discharge, you can move a habeas corpus petition for unlawful detention if they do not let him go, or go to consumer courts for violation of patient rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear sir,The course of action to be followed is given below1. Legal Ground for Property TransferRights of Ownership: According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, amended in 2005, all children (including daughters) are equally entitled to ancestral property. Because your father's plots were jointly held in your mother's name, on her passing away in 2022, her share automatically goes to all four legal heirs (you and your three sisters). The legal heir certificate that is issued by the Tehsil (mentioning your mother and four children) is considered as a valid document is considered sufficient in proving your status as legal heirs. The Tehsil cannot further choose to refuse this on grounds without providing any proper legal justification.2. Tehsil's Refusal: Addressing Their ConcernsThe Tehsil's denial on the grounds of your non-residence and absence of local address evidence is not legally sustainable. Mutation and property transfer are based on rights of ownership, not residence. Procedural obstacles can be overcome as follows:Steps to Overcome Tehsil's Objections:File Relinquishment Deeds from Sisters:As your sisters are married but agree, they need to sign registered relinquishment deeds (on stamp paper) specifically handing over their share in their favour.  This is a required under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.The following are the documents are required:The relinquishment deeds with the signatures of sisters and two witnesses.Sisters' notarized affidavits asserting their agreement.A Copy of the legal heir certificate and the death certificates of your parents.It is recommended to provide the ID proof such as the Aadhaar, PAN, or Voter ID (even with non-local addresses)It is also further recommended to take an affidavit stating the reason why the family shifted out in 2014 and submit the relevant reasons (e.g., work, studies) to avoid confusion.Affidavits of neighbours/relatives in the original area attesting to your family's ownership and your identity can serve as witness statements.Make a written application (through your lawyer) requesting the Tehsil to carry out a field inquiry to confirm the historical ownership records and the testimonies of local people (e.g. neighbours, ex-tenants).3. Legal Remedies if Tehsil Continues in RefusalIf the Tehsil still refuses the mutation , in such cases:Option 1: File a Revision PetitionProceed to Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) under Section 210 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, opposing the inaction of the Tehsil.Option 2: File a Writ Petition in the High CourtFile a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court for a writ of mandamus (to direct the Tehsil to apply the mutation).4. The important Documents required include the following:Legal heir certificate ( mentioning the mother and four children in it).The Death certificates of the parents.Both the sisters' relinquishment deeds (registered).Respective affidavits of non-residence and the witness statements.The Title deeds to the property (in mother's name).Provide for the indemnity bond (if it is being required by the Tehsil).5. The Practical Tips which may be necessary.Recommended to hire a Local Lawyer: A local lawyer can handle the case at hand with the Tehsil, it would help to speed up the field verification. The lawyer can also appear for you at hearings.To file a Grievance Online: Utilize the government portal (upbhulekh.gov.in) to raise a complaint or check mutation status of the property at hand.Take advantage of the Legal Heir Certificate: It is important to highlight that this certificate serves as a valid evidence of inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a GPA holder of a villa become residents welfare association President?",
    "answer": "Based on the facts you've shared, I can confirm that under established law, particularly GPA holder is not recognised as the legal owner of a property. Ownership is determined strictly through a registered sale deed in the individual's name.If your society's nomination form required candidates to self-declare ownership backed by a registered sale deed, and the current office bearer does not meet this requirement, then his election may be legally invalid and open to formal challenge.The general secretary’s position, even if backed by legal advice, cannot override statutory provisions or Supreme Court precedent. Such situations—if not addressed now—can indeed set problematic precedents and compromise the integrity of future elections and society governance.I would be happy to assist you in resolving this decisively—whether through a structured notice, a review of the society bye-laws, or by initiating corrective action via the Registrar of Societies. This matter calls for a precise legal approach to ensure compliance and protect the interests of all genuine stakeholders.Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can take this forward efficiently.Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "answer": "In Karnataka, under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960 (KSRA), the eligibility of a General Power of Attorney (GPA) holder to become an office bearer depends largely on the society’s bye-laws. Here’s what you need to consider:1. GPA Holder vs. Property Owner- AGPA holder is not considered the legal ownerof the property. TheSupreme Court of Indiahas ruled thatGPA does not confer ownership rightsunless aregistered sale deedis executed.- If your society’snomination form explicitly required ownership,then the current president may not be eligible to hold office.2. Society Bye-Laws & Legal Counsel’s Interpretation- If your bye-laws do not mention GPA holders, the general secretary cannot unilaterally decide that a GPA holder is eligible.- The legal counsel’s opinion is advisory, but it cannot override the bye-laws or the Supreme Court’s ruling.3. Steps You Can Take- Challenge the appointment: If the election committee did not verify ownership, members canfile a formal objectionwith theRegistrar of Societies.- Request an amendment: If members feel this sets a bad precedent, propose an amendment to the bye-laws toexplicitly exclude GPA holdersfrom office bearer positions.- Seek legal intervention: If the general secretary refuses to act, members canapproach the Karnataka High Courtfor clarification.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

Legal Remedies if Tehsil Continues in RefusalIf the Tehsil still refuses the mutation , in such cases:Option 1: File a Revision PetitionProceed to Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) under Section 210 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, opposing the inaction of the Tehsil.Option 2: File a Writ Petition in the High CourtFile a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court for a writ of mandamus (to direct the Tehsil to apply the mutation).4. The important Documents required include the following:Legal heir certificate ( mentioning the mother and four children in it).The Death certificates of the parents.Both the sisters' relinquishment deeds (registered).Respective affidavits of non-residence and the witness statements.The Title deeds to the property (in mother's name).Provide for the indemnity bond (if it is being required by the Tehsil).5. The Practical Tips which may be necessary.Recommended to hire a Local Lawyer: A local lawyer can handle the case at hand with the Tehsil, it would help to speed up the field verification. The lawyer can also appear for you at hearings.To file a Grievance Online: Utilize the government portal (upbhulekh.gov.in) to raise a complaint or check mutation status of the property at hand.Take advantage of the Legal Heir Certificate: It is important to highlight that this certificate serves as a valid evidence of inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Injunction, court vacations, no written arguments, what to do next?",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,According to the existing law and judicial practice in Karnataka, the following are elaborate answers to your questions concerning your child custody case pending before the Family Court, Bangalore:1. If you receive a negative order on 23rd April 2025, when can you move the High Court for a stay? Do you have to wait until June 1st when courts resume or can you move the vacation bench?Right to Appeal and Stay:You are entitled to appeal the Family Court's order to the Karnataka High Court. Appeals in family cases such as custody are normally heard early in view of the sensitive nature entailing the well-being of a child.Vacation Bench Availability:Given the case at hand, you need not wait until June 1st when regular courts resume. You can instead choose to approach the vacation bench immediately after the order is delivered with a petition for stay or interim relief.Practical Steps to be taken :File the appeal and stay application at the earliest after the judgement.Seek the urgent listing prior to vacation bench on grounds of welfare of the child and after elaborating the issues of injunction .The courts usually give priority to such cases during vacations to avoid irreparable injury to the parties of the case.2. If the existing injunction against removal of the child from Bangalore is vacated, can your wife relocate the child to her hometown and enroll the child in school by June? How simple will it be to bring the child back?Effect of Vacating Injunction: If the Family Court quashes the injunction restraining removal of the child from Bangalore jurisdiction, by law your wife can move the child to her hometown.Admission to School: As mentioned after moving from Bangalore, she can further choose to enroll the child in a school there by June, as the school admission is normally on the basis of residence and guardianship.Difficulty in Bringing Child Back: It can be difficult and legally tricky to bring the child back to Bangalore after relocation. The custody orders and the child's ordinary residence are considered very crucial. You might be in a position to file a new custody petition in the new jurisdiction or file for modification of custody orders, which can be time-consuming and emotionally draining after relocation of the child3. Is it a good idea to file written arguments on the next hearing date?It is a cautious approach, particularly in sensitive cases with regard to that of child custody. Filing the written argument can be beneficial as it helps to:Present your legal and factual arguments clearly.The judge may also appreciate your side of the case fully.Maintaining the record of your submissions, which is useful in appeals or review.Improve your case and provides a positive impression on the recordTiming:As the court has listed the case for orders and no written arguments have been filed so far, filing well-written written arguments on the next date or even prior to the vacation period can positively affect the court's decision.Other Legal ConsiderationsThe courts give precedence to the child's best interest and welfare over everything else in custody cases. The Courts commonly grant interim custody or visitation rights balancing the interests of both parents, particularly during pendency of final orders.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I file cheating case on my wife and in-laws under 420 IPC",
    "answer": "Given the facts you've shared, here's an analysis of your situation from a legal perspective:Legal Considerations underIPC Section 420(Cheating)Section 420of theIndian Penal Code(IPC)deals with the offence of \"cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property\" and can be invoked when someone, by deceitful means, induces another person to part with property (money, assets, etc.) or to do something they would not have done otherwise.To constitute an offence underSection 420IPC, the following elements must be present:Dishonest Inducement:There must be a clear intention to deceive or induce the victim into parting with money, or property, or agreeing to something based on false representations. In your case, the businessman misrepresented his adopted daughter’s status and the family’s financial stability (regarding the schools, colleges, and hospitals).Fraudulent or Misleading Representation:The businessman claimed that your wife was adopted legally and misrepresented his business interests. This constitutes a fraudulent or misleading statement. If this claim was false and you can demonstrate that it was made with the intent to induce you into marrying his daughter, it might qualify under this section.Delivery of Property or Valuable Consideration:In your case, you were induced into marriage under false pretences, and during the marriage, your wife’s biological parents misused money, transferring significant sums to themselves, which could be considered a form of fraudulent behaviour or financial deceit.Intention to Cause Loss:You would need to demonstrate that you suffered a financial, personal, or emotional loss due to the false representations made by the businessman, your wife, and her biological parents.Can You File a Cheating Case?Yes, based on the elements mentioned, there are grounds to file a case underSection 420IPCagainst the businessman for misrepresentation (regarding the adoption) and deceitful conduct. If there is evidence that his false claims led you to make a financial or personal decision you wouldn’t have made otherwise (like marrying his daughter and being deceived into certain financial commitments), you may have a case.Similarly, if your wife and her biological parents were complicit in this misrepresentation or further caused you harm (such as through financial mismanagement or wrongful transfers), they may also be implicated in the offence of cheating.Steps to Take for Filing a Case underSection 420IPC:Gather Evidence:Document the Misrepresentations:Collect any evidence, such as emails, messages, or documents, where the businessman misrepresented his daughter's adoption status or made false claims about the family’s business.Financial Records:Gather proof of any financial mismanagement, such as bank transactions showing transfers to your wife’s biological parents or evidence of any undue influence they had on financial matters.Witness Statements:If there are witnesses who can testify to the businessman’s claims or any fraudulent behaviour on the part of your wife or her biological parents, these can support your case.File a Complaint with the Police:Approach thelocal police stationand file a formal complaint underSection 420IPC, detailing the false claims made by the businessman and the financial deceit caused by your wife’s family. You can also file acomplaint under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust)and506 (criminal intimidation), if applicable, depending on the circumstances.Consult with a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in criminal law and matrimonial matters can guide you on the exact procedure, help draft the complaint, and represent you in court if necessary.Your lawyer may also advise you on whether you can file the case in conjunction with divorce proceedings, which could strengthen your position.Civil Remedies:In addition to criminal proceedings, you may also explore civil remedies, including asuit for damagesfor the financial and emotional harm caused by the deceitful conduct of the businessman and your wife’s biological parents.ConclusionYour case has potential grounds for filing acheating case underSection 420IPCif you can establish that the businessman’s false representations induced you into a marriage that led to financial, emotional, and personal harm. To proceed, gather evidence, file a formal police complaint, and consult with a lawyer to ensure you pursue the appropriate legal remedies.If you need further assistance in drafting the complaint or pursuing legal action, feel free to reach out.Warm regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the facts provided, you may have grounds to file a case underSection 318 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) of 2023 defines cheating, as you were allegedly deceived into the marriage through false claims about your wife’s adoption and promises regarding her future role in managing institutions. To qualify under Section 318, you must prove that there was a deliberate intention to deceive you at the time of the marriage proposal, resulting in personal and financial loss. The businessman’s misrepresentation, coupled with your wife’s financial misconduct and her biological parents' alleged conspiracy, strengthens your case. To initiate legal action, file a criminal complaint with the police detailing the sequence of events, the misrepresentation, and the consequent harm. Ensure you present all evidence, including written communications, financial records, and witnesses, to substantiate your claims. It is advisable to consult a criminal lawyer to draft a robust complaint and represent you in court.

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

The recovery of debt is not limited to recovery from the actual debtor to the bank or financial institution but is extended to recovery from other persons who are indebted to the debtor called \"third party debtorders\" or \"garnisheeorders\". Sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 28 are in the nature of garnishment proceedings. A garnishment is a proceeding by which a diligent creditor may legally obtain preference on other creditors by sequestration of the effects of a debtor in the hands of his debtorIf a court is passing an order to recover the amount from the  salary through the employer, i.e., by a garnishee order, thena garnishee order  cannot exceed 50% of a debtor's monthly income.This is to ensure the debtor has enough income to meet basic needs.There are also exemptions for certain types of income like minimum wages.Therefore you may wait for the court judgment in this regard and plan further steps accordinlgy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "My parents properties are in different state and ID address as well. Can I get legal heirship coz I live in other state now?",
    "answer": "Dear sir,The course of action to be followed is given below1. Legal Ground for Property TransferRights of Ownership: According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, amended in 2005, all children (including daughters) are equally entitled to ancestral property. Because your father's plots were jointly held in your mother's name, on her passing away in 2022, her share automatically goes to all four legal heirs (you and your three sisters). The legal heir certificate that is issued by the Tehsil (mentioning your mother and four children) is considered as a valid document is considered sufficient in proving your status as legal heirs. The Tehsil cannot further choose to refuse this on grounds without providing any proper legal justification.2. Tehsil's Refusal: Addressing Their ConcernsThe Tehsil's denial on the grounds of your non-residence and absence of local address evidence is not legally sustainable. Mutation and property transfer are based on rights of ownership, not residence. Procedural obstacles can be overcome as follows:Steps to Overcome Tehsil's Objections:File Relinquishment Deeds from Sisters:As your sisters are married but agree, they need to sign registered relinquishment deeds (on stamp paper) specifically handing over their share in their favour.  This is a required under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.The following are the documents are required:The relinquishment deeds with the signatures of sisters and two witnesses.Sisters' notarized affidavits asserting their agreement.A Copy of the legal heir certificate and the death certificates of your parents.It is recommended to provide the ID proof such as the Aadhaar, PAN, or Voter ID (even with non-local addresses)It is also further recommended to take an affidavit stating the reason why the family shifted out in 2014 and submit the relevant reasons (e.g., work, studies) to avoid confusion.Affidavits of neighbours/relatives in the original area attesting to your family's ownership and your identity can serve as witness statements.Make a written application (through your lawyer) requesting the Tehsil to carry out a field inquiry to confirm the historical ownership records and the testimonies of local people (e.g. neighbours, ex-tenants).3. Legal Remedies if Tehsil Continues in RefusalIf the Tehsil still refuses the mutation , in such cases:Option 1: File a Revision PetitionProceed to Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) under Section 210 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, opposing the inaction of the Tehsil.Option 2: File a Writ Petition in the High CourtFile a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court for a writ of mandamus (to direct the Tehsil to apply the mutation).4. The important Documents required include the following:Legal heir certificate ( mentioning the mother and four children in it).The Death certificates of the parents.Both the sisters' relinquishment deeds (registered).Respective affidavits of non-residence and the witness statements.The Title deeds to the property (in mother's name).Provide for the indemnity bond (if it is being required by the Tehsil).5. The Practical Tips which may be necessary.Recommended to hire a Local Lawyer: A local lawyer can handle the case at hand with the Tehsil, it would help to speed up the field verification. The lawyer can also appear for you at hearings.To file a Grievance Online: Utilize the government portal (upbhulekh.gov.in) to raise a complaint or check mutation status of the property at hand.Take advantage of the Legal Heir Certificate: It is important to highlight that this certificate serves as a valid evidence of inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,According to the existing law and judicial practice in Karnataka, the following are elaborate answers to your questions concerning your child custody case pending before the Family Court, Bangalore:1. If you receive a negative order on 23rd April 2025, when can you move the High Court for a stay? Do you have to wait until June 1st when courts resume or can you move the vacation bench?Right to Appeal and Stay:You are entitled to appeal the Family Court's order to the Karnataka High Court. Appeals in family cases such as custody are normally heard early in view of the sensitive nature entailing the well-being of a child.Vacation Bench Availability:Given the case at hand, you need not wait until June 1st when regular courts resume. You can instead choose to approach the vacation bench immediately after the order is delivered with a petition for stay or interim relief.Practical Steps to be taken :File the appeal and stay application at the earliest after the judgement.Seek the urgent listing prior to vacation bench on grounds of welfare of the child and after elaborating the issues of injunction .The courts usually give priority to such cases during vacations to avoid irreparable injury to the parties of the case.2. If the existing injunction against removal of the child from Bangalore is vacated, can your wife relocate the child to her hometown and enroll the child in school by June? How simple will it be to bring the child back?Effect of Vacating Injunction: If the Family Court quashes the injunction restraining removal of the child from Bangalore jurisdiction, by law your wife can move the child to her hometown.Admission to School: As mentioned after moving from Bangalore, she can further choose to enroll the child in a school there by June, as the school admission is normally on the basis of residence and guardianship.Difficulty in Bringing Child Back: It can be difficult and legally tricky to bring the child back to Bangalore after relocation. The custody orders and the child's ordinary residence are considered very crucial. You might be in a position to file a new custody petition in the new jurisdiction or file for modification of custody orders, which can be time-consuming and emotionally draining after relocation of the child3. Is it a good idea to file written arguments on the next hearing date?It is a cautious approach, particularly in sensitive cases with regard to that of child custody. Filing the written argument can be beneficial as it helps to:Present your legal and factual arguments clearly.The judge may also appreciate your side of the case fully.Maintaining the record of your submissions, which is useful in appeals or review.Improve your case and provides a positive impression on the recordTiming:As the court has listed the case for orders and no written arguments have been filed so far, filing well-written written arguments on the next date or even prior to the vacation period can positively affect the court's decision.Other Legal ConsiderationsThe courts give precedence to the child's best interest and welfare over everything else in custody cases. The Courts commonly grant interim custody or visitation rights balancing the interests of both parents, particularly during pendency of final orders.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a GPA holder of a villa become residents welfare association President?",
    "answer": "Based on the facts you've shared, I can confirm that under established law, particularly GPA holder is not recognised as the legal owner of a property. Ownership is determined strictly through a registered sale deed in the individual's name.If your society's nomination form required candidates to self-declare ownership backed by a registered sale deed, and the current office bearer does not meet this requirement, then his election may be legally invalid and open to formal challenge.The general secretary’s position, even if backed by legal advice, cannot override statutory provisions or Supreme Court precedent. Such situations—if not addressed now—can indeed set problematic precedents and compromise the integrity of future elections and society governance.I would be happy to assist you in resolving this decisively—whether through a structured notice, a review of the society bye-laws, or by initiating corrective action via the Registrar of Societies. This matter calls for a precise legal approach to ensure compliance and protect the interests of all genuine stakeholders.Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can take this forward efficiently.Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "answer": "In Karnataka, under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960 (KSRA), the eligibility of a General Power of Attorney (GPA) holder to become an office bearer depends largely on the society’s bye-laws. Here’s what you need to consider:1. GPA Holder vs. Property Owner- AGPA holder is not considered the legal ownerof the property. TheSupreme Court of Indiahas ruled thatGPA does not confer ownership rightsunless aregistered sale deedis executed.- If your society’snomination form explicitly required ownership,then the current president may not be eligible to hold office.2. Society Bye-Laws & Legal Counsel’s Interpretation- If your bye-laws do not mention GPA holders, the general secretary cannot unilaterally decide that a GPA holder is eligible.- The legal counsel’s opinion is advisory, but it cannot override the bye-laws or the Supreme Court’s ruling.3. Steps You Can Take- Challenge the appointment: If the election committee did not verify ownership, members canfile a formal objectionwith theRegistrar of Societies.- Request an amendment: If members feel this sets a bad precedent, propose an amendment to the bye-laws toexplicitly exclude GPA holdersfrom office bearer positions.- Seek legal intervention: If the general secretary refuses to act, members canapproach the Karnataka High Courtfor clarification.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "question": "Is it safe to buy a property where a 2010 Registered sale agreement is not canceled?",
    "answer": "It is not safe to purchase the proposed property because a litigation is pending before court in this regard, once the case filed by the land owner is disposed and if the judgment is in his favor then after the expiry of the period to prefer appeal, you can obtain a legal opinion from an experienced lawyer to proceed with the proposed purchase.You must note tht the agreement holder has given a substantial amount towards purchase of the property hence the risk is that in caase he turns up then the court may pas a verdict in his favor too because it is not barred by limitation as the land owner himself has re-activated the expired agreement by approaching the court hence the agreement gets a new period of limitation from the date of filing the suit by the landownerT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

But the risk will always be thereAn ex parte judgment will simply not come in aid as it can always be set aside.

    "answer": "No, a GPA holder is not considered the legal owneras per the Supreme Court (Suraj Lamp case, 2011). If your society’s nomination form required a registered sale deed in the candidate’s name, the current president isnot eligible.The General Secretary’s claim that a GPA holder can act as an owner is incorrect for society membership and election purposes—unless your bye-laws specifically allow it(which they don’t).His appointment isinvalid, and this can set a wrong precedent.Suggested actions:Raise a written objection to the Executive Committee.Call for a Special General Body Meeting.Escalate to the Registrar of Societies if needed.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Can a GPA holder of a villa become residents welfare association President?",
    "answer": "Based on the facts you've shared, I can confirm that under established law, particularly GPA holder is not recognised as the legal owner of a property. Ownership is determined strictly through a registered sale deed in the individual's name.If your society's nomination form required candidates to self-declare ownership backed by a registered sale deed, and the current office bearer does not meet this requirement, then his election may be legally invalid and open to formal challenge.The general secretary’s position, even if backed by legal advice, cannot override statutory provisions or Supreme Court precedent. Such situations—if not addressed now—can indeed set problematic precedents and compromise the integrity of future elections and society governance.I would be happy to assist you in resolving this decisively—whether through a structured notice, a review of the society bye-laws, or by initiating corrective action via the Registrar of Societies. This matter calls for a precise legal approach to ensure compliance and protect the interests of all genuine stakeholders.Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can take this forward efficiently.Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "answer": "The GPA deed is neither a title document nor the power agent can be treated as a owner of the property for any reason.The election to association clearly mandates apart from other eligibility conditions that a person contesting the election should be an absolute owner with registered title document on his or her name.The current president has occupied the post by playing fraud and the opinion obtained from an advocate in this regard is also legally incorrect.A special meeting of the association can be called for discussing about this irregularity and to strip the president of his post, to conduct fresh election for the post of the president with the concurrence of the deputy registrar of cooperative society.If the management committee is not in favour of this proposal then you can make a complaint about this irregularity to the deputy registrar of cooperative society for intervention and for passing suitable orders as prescribed in law for this purpose.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can a GPA holder of a villa become residents welfare association President?",
    "answer": "In Karnataka, under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960 (KSRA), the eligibility of a General Power of Attorney (GPA) holder to become an office bearer depends largely on the society’s bye-laws. Here’s what you need to consider:1. GPA Holder vs. Property Owner- AGPA holder is not considered the legal ownerof the property. TheSupreme Court of Indiahas ruled thatGPA does not confer ownership rightsunless aregistered sale deedis executed.- If your society’snomination form explicitly required ownership,then the current president may not be eligible to hold office.2. Society Bye-Laws & Legal Counsel’s Interpretation- If your bye-laws do not mention GPA holders, the general secretary cannot unilaterally decide that a GPA holder is eligible.- The legal counsel’s opinion is advisory, but it cannot override the bye-laws or the Supreme Court’s ruling.3. Steps You Can Take- Challenge the appointment: If the election committee did not verify ownership, members canfile a formal objectionwith theRegistrar of Societies.- Request an amendment: If members feel this sets a bad precedent, propose an amendment to the bye-laws toexplicitly exclude GPA holdersfrom office bearer positions.- Seek legal intervention: If the general secretary refuses to act, members canapproach the Karnataka High Courtfor clarification.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

    "question": "Can I file cheating case on my wife and in-laws under 420 IPC",
    "answer": "Given the facts you've shared, here's an analysis of your situation from a legal perspective:Legal Considerations underIPC Section 420(Cheating)Section 420of theIndian Penal Code(IPC)deals with the offence of \"cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property\" and can be invoked when someone, by deceitful means, induces another person to part with property (money, assets, etc.) or to do something they would not have done otherwise.To constitute an offence underSection 420IPC, the following elements must be present:Dishonest Inducement:There must be a clear intention to deceive or induce the victim into parting with money, or property, or agreeing to something based on false representations. In your case, the businessman misrepresented his adopted daughter’s status and the family’s financial stability (regarding the schools, colleges, and hospitals).Fraudulent or Misleading Representation:The businessman claimed that your wife was adopted legally and misrepresented his business interests. This constitutes a fraudulent or misleading statement. If this claim was false and you can demonstrate that it was made with the intent to induce you into marrying his daughter, it might qualify under this section.Delivery of Property or Valuable Consideration:In your case, you were induced into marriage under false pretences, and during the marriage, your wife’s biological parents misused money, transferring significant sums to themselves, which could be considered a form of fraudulent behaviour or financial deceit.Intention to Cause Loss:You would need to demonstrate that you suffered a financial, personal, or emotional loss due to the false representations made by the businessman, your wife, and her biological parents.Can You File a Cheating Case?Yes, based on the elements mentioned, there are grounds to file a case underSection 420IPCagainst the businessman for misrepresentation (regarding the adoption) and deceitful conduct. If there is evidence that his false claims led you to make a financial or personal decision you wouldn’t have made otherwise (like marrying his daughter and being deceived into certain financial commitments), you may have a case.Similarly, if your wife and her biological parents were complicit in this misrepresentation or further caused you harm (such as through financial mismanagement or wrongful transfers), they may also be implicated in the offence of cheating.Steps to Take for Filing a Case underSection 420IPC:Gather Evidence:Document the Misrepresentations:Collect any evidence, such as emails, messages, or documents, where the businessman misrepresented his daughter's adoption status or made false claims about the family’s business.Financial Records:Gather proof of any financial mismanagement, such as bank transactions showing transfers to your wife’s biological parents or evidence of any undue influence they had on financial matters.Witness Statements:If there are witnesses who can testify to the businessman’s claims or any fraudulent behaviour on the part of your wife or her biological parents, these can support your case.File a Complaint with the Police:Approach thelocal police stationand file a formal complaint underSection 420IPC, detailing the false claims made by the businessman and the financial deceit caused by your wife’s family. You can also file acomplaint under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust)and506 (criminal intimidation), if applicable, depending on the circumstances.Consult with a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in criminal law and matrimonial matters can guide you on the exact procedure, help draft the complaint, and represent you in court if necessary.Your lawyer may also advise you on whether you can file the case in conjunction with divorce proceedings, which could strengthen your position.Civil Remedies:In addition to criminal proceedings, you may also explore civil remedies, including asuit for damagesfor the financial and emotional harm caused by the deceitful conduct of the businessman and your wife’s biological parents.ConclusionYour case has potential grounds for filing acheating case underSection 420IPCif you can establish that the businessman’s false representations induced you into a marriage that led to financial, emotional, and personal harm. To proceed, gather evidence, file a formal police complaint, and consult with a lawyer to ensure you pursue the appropriate legal remedies.If you need further assistance in drafting the complaint or pursuing legal action, feel free to reach out.Warm regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the facts provided, you may have grounds to file a case underSection 318 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) of 2023 defines cheating, as you were allegedly deceived into the marriage through false claims about your wife’s adoption and promises regarding her future role in managing institutions. To qualify under Section 318, you must prove that there was a deliberate intention to deceive you at the time of the marriage proposal, resulting in personal and financial loss. The businessman’s misrepresentation, coupled with your wife’s financial misconduct and her biological parents' alleged conspiracy, strengthens your case. To initiate legal action, file a criminal complaint with the police detailing the sequence of events, the misrepresentation, and the consequent harm. Ensure you present all evidence, including written communications, financial records, and witnesses, to substantiate your claims. It is advisable to consult a criminal lawyer to draft a robust complaint and represent you in court.

    "question": "Who has the right to replace an unmarried litigant in an eviction case filed by him on behalf of the joint family",
    "answer": "As the eviction action pertains to a commercial shop that is joint property of the whole family (all co-sharers), the action must be prosecuted by an individual or individuals lawfully authorized to act in the joint interest of all co-sharers. Your cousin, being the only signatory and plaintiff in the suit, has died unmarried and without legal heirs (children). His interest in the property and in the suit rights falls on his legal heirs, who are his brothers, under theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended). As your cousin passed away intestate and unmarried, his legal heirs are his siblings (brothers). They inherit his share in the property and his rights in the suit. Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution. The brothers should be substituted in time to prevent dismissal for non-prosecution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the tenant has committed wilful default in payment of monthly rental amount continuously for two months or more then you can issue a legal notice to him instructing him to vacate and deliver vacant possession by giving him 60 days time to do so. The reason for eviction can affect the notice period, with breaches of the lease agreement potentially leading to shorter notice periods.It may be noted  that if the tenant committed wilful default in payment of rent, for thetwo consecutive months, then the landlord is entitled to issue an eviction notice giving him time to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession.Failing to comply with the demands made, the landlord can file an eviction suit.The time taken for disposal of eviction suit cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it and it may take more than two years also.You can give a power of attorney deed in favor of your close relative in India to conduct the case on your behalf.The litigation expenses and the lawyer's fee will be intimated by the lawyer who you may be engaging for this purpose.Money recovery suit can be filed separately for the money you have lent to the tenant on the basis of the documentary evidences for proving the money transactions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney.Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details.Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings.Process to be followed:Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible).If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers.For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned.Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant defaulting on rent",
    "answer": "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points.2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress.3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate.4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case.5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances.It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively.Atavarish VarshiAdvocate, Navi Mumbai15 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Atavarish Varshi"

The Right to Health is a fundamental right, and patients have the right to be discharged when they are medically stable, regardless of their ability to pay.While a hospital may discuss treatment options with a terminally ill patient and their family, they cannot force the patient to continue with expensive or unnecessary treatments against their will. The patient or their surrogate can make decisions about withdrawing or limiting treatment, especially if it's not in their best interest or if they wish to prioritize palliative care.A patient can file a writ petition under Article 226 or 32 of theConstitution of Indiato challenge a hospital's decision to discharge the patient immediately solely because of their inability to pay for expensive treatments, including those that may be deemed unnecessaryT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Hospital forcing discharge of paying bedridden terminal patient",
    "answer": "According to the Indian law and patient rights , a hospital cannot forcibly discharge or detain a patient against the patient's or their authorized family members' will, particularly when the basic charges are being paid and the patient or family wants to continue care or postpone discharge in particular. The \"comfort-care-only\" form you signed upholds your right to refuse aggressive treatments such as strong antibiotics, and the hospital has to honor this informed decision without coercion.Can the hospital discharge your father over your objection?The hospital cannot discharge him unilaterally just because you didn't want some treatments, particularly if he remains medically stable and basic payments are being met.If the hospital does insist on the discharge of the patient, they have to provide a \"dignified transfer\" with continuity of care, either in the patient's home or in an another facility.The hospital's argument that untreated infection can harm others does not warrant forced discharge without due medical evidence or alternative arrangements.How do you prevent or delay discharge legally?Write clearly in an email or letter your willingness to pay all the basic charges and your request for continued admission for at least 1–2 weeks to arrange care.If the hospital goes ahead with enforced discharge, you can move a habeas corpus petition for unlawful detention if they do not let him go, or go to consumer courts for violation of patient rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Injunction, court vacations, no written arguments, what to do next?",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,According to the existing law and judicial practice in Karnataka, the following are elaborate answers to your questions concerning your child custody case pending before the Family Court, Bangalore:1. If you receive a negative order on 23rd April 2025, when can you move the High Court for a stay? Do you have to wait until June 1st when courts resume or can you move the vacation bench?Right to Appeal and Stay:You are entitled to appeal the Family Court's order to the Karnataka High Court. Appeals in family cases such as custody are normally heard early in view of the sensitive nature entailing the well-being of a child.Vacation Bench Availability:Given the case at hand, you need not wait until June 1st when regular courts resume. You can instead choose to approach the vacation bench immediately after the order is delivered with a petition for stay or interim relief.Practical Steps to be taken :File the appeal and stay application at the earliest after the judgement.Seek the urgent listing prior to vacation bench on grounds of welfare of the child and after elaborating the issues of injunction .The courts usually give priority to such cases during vacations to avoid irreparable injury to the parties of the case.2. If the existing injunction against removal of the child from Bangalore is vacated, can your wife relocate the child to her hometown and enroll the child in school by June? How simple will it be to bring the child back?Effect of Vacating Injunction: If the Family Court quashes the injunction restraining removal of the child from Bangalore jurisdiction, by law your wife can move the child to her hometown.Admission to School: As mentioned after moving from Bangalore, she can further choose to enroll the child in a school there by June, as the school admission is normally on the basis of residence and guardianship.Difficulty in Bringing Child Back: It can be difficult and legally tricky to bring the child back to Bangalore after relocation. The custody orders and the child's ordinary residence are considered very crucial. You might be in a position to file a new custody petition in the new jurisdiction or file for modification of custody orders, which can be time-consuming and emotionally draining after relocation of the child3. Is it a good idea to file written arguments on the next hearing date?It is a cautious approach, particularly in sensitive cases with regard to that of child custody. Filing the written argument can be beneficial as it helps to:Present your legal and factual arguments clearly.The judge may also appreciate your side of the case fully.Maintaining the record of your submissions, which is useful in appeals or review.Improve your case and provides a positive impression on the recordTiming:As the court has listed the case for orders and no written arguments have been filed so far, filing well-written written arguments on the next date or even prior to the vacation period can positively affect the court's decision.Other Legal ConsiderationsThe courts give precedence to the child's best interest and welfare over everything else in custody cases. The Courts commonly grant interim custody or visitation rights balancing the interests of both parents, particularly during pendency of final orders.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Given the facts you've shared, here's an analysis of your situation from a legal perspective:Legal Considerations underIPC Section 420(Cheating)Section 420of theIndian Penal Code(IPC)deals with the offence of \"cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property\" and can be invoked when someone, by deceitful means, induces another person to part with property (money, assets, etc.) or to do something they would not have done otherwise.To constitute an offence underSection 420IPC, the following elements must be present:Dishonest Inducement:There must be a clear intention to deceive or induce the victim into parting with money, or property, or agreeing to something based on false representations. In your case, the businessman misrepresented his adopted daughter’s status and the family’s financial stability (regarding the schools, colleges, and hospitals).Fraudulent or Misleading Representation:The businessman claimed that your wife was adopted legally and misrepresented his business interests. This constitutes a fraudulent or misleading statement. If this claim was false and you can demonstrate that it was made with the intent to induce you into marrying his daughter, it might qualify under this section.Delivery of Property or Valuable Consideration:In your case, you were induced into marriage under false pretences, and during the marriage, your wife’s biological parents misused money, transferring significant sums to themselves, which could be considered a form of fraudulent behaviour or financial deceit.Intention to Cause Loss:You would need to demonstrate that you suffered a financial, personal, or emotional loss due to the false representations made by the businessman, your wife, and her biological parents.Can You File a Cheating Case?Yes, based on the elements mentioned, there are grounds to file a case underSection 420IPCagainst the businessman for misrepresentation (regarding the adoption) and deceitful conduct. If there is evidence that his false claims led you to make a financial or personal decision you wouldn’t have made otherwise (like marrying his daughter and being deceived into certain financial commitments), you may have a case.Similarly, if your wife and her biological parents were complicit in this misrepresentation or further caused you harm (such as through financial mismanagement or wrongful transfers), they may also be implicated in the offence of cheating.Steps to Take for Filing a Case underSection 420IPC:Gather Evidence:Document the Misrepresentations:Collect any evidence, such as emails, messages, or documents, where the businessman misrepresented his daughter's adoption status or made false claims about the family’s business.Financial Records:Gather proof of any financial mismanagement, such as bank transactions showing transfers to your wife’s biological parents or evidence of any undue influence they had on financial matters.Witness Statements:If there are witnesses who can testify to the businessman’s claims or any fraudulent behaviour on the part of your wife or her biological parents, these can support your case.File a Complaint with the Police:Approach thelocal police stationand file a formal complaint underSection 420IPC, detailing the false claims made by the businessman and the financial deceit caused by your wife’s family. You can also file acomplaint under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust)and506 (criminal intimidation), if applicable, depending on the circumstances.Consult with a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in criminal law and matrimonial matters can guide you on the exact procedure, help draft the complaint, and represent you in court if necessary.Your lawyer may also advise you on whether you can file the case in conjunction with divorce proceedings, which could strengthen your position.Civil Remedies:In addition to criminal proceedings, you may also explore civil remedies, including asuit for damagesfor the financial and emotional harm caused by the deceitful conduct of the businessman and your wife’s biological parents.ConclusionYour case has potential grounds for filing acheating case underSection 420IPCif you can establish that the businessman’s false representations induced you into a marriage that led to financial, emotional, and personal harm. To proceed, gather evidence, file a formal police complaint, and consult with a lawyer to ensure you pursue the appropriate legal remedies.If you need further assistance in drafting the complaint or pursuing legal action, feel free to reach out.Warm regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

To qualify under Section 318, you must prove that there was a deliberate intention to deceive you at the time of the marriage proposal, resulting in personal and financial loss. The businessman’s misrepresentation, coupled with your wife’s financial misconduct and her biological parents' alleged conspiracy, strengthens your case. To initiate legal action, file a criminal complaint with the police detailing the sequence of events, the misrepresentation, and the consequent harm. Ensure you present all evidence, including written communications, financial records, and witnesses, to substantiate your claims. It is advisable to consult a criminal lawyer to draft a robust complaint and represent you in court. Let me know if you need further assistance.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Who has the right to replace an unmarried litigant in an eviction case filed by him on behalf of the joint family",
    "answer": "As the eviction action pertains to a commercial shop that is joint property of the whole family (all co-sharers), the action must be prosecuted by an individual or individuals lawfully authorized to act in the joint interest of all co-sharers. Your cousin, being the only signatory and plaintiff in the suit, has died unmarried and without legal heirs (children). His interest in the property and in the suit rights falls on his legal heirs, who are his brothers, under theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended). As your cousin passed away intestate and unmarried, his legal heirs are his siblings (brothers). They inherit his share in the property and his rights in the suit. Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution. The brothers should be substituted in time to prevent dismissal for non-prosecution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Hospital forcing discharge of paying bedridden terminal patient",
    "answer": "A hospital in India cannot force a terminal illness patient to be discharged immediately solely due to the patient's inability to bear the high expenses of treatment, even if it involves unnecessary medications. A hospital cannot detain a patient against their will, especially over a payment dispute. The Right to Health is a fundamental right, and patients have the right to be discharged when they are medically stable, regardless of their ability to pay.While a hospital may discuss treatment options with a terminally ill patient and their family, they cannot force the patient to continue with expensive or unnecessary treatments against their will. The patient or their surrogate can make decisions about withdrawing or limiting treatment, especially if it's not in their best interest or if they wish to prioritize palliative care.A patient can file a writ petition under Article 226 or 32 of theConstitution of Indiato challenge a hospital's decision to discharge the patient immediately solely because of their inability to pay for expensive treatments, including those that may be deemed unnecessaryT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Hospital forcing discharge of paying bedridden terminal patient",
    "answer": "According to the Indian law and patient rights , a hospital cannot forcibly discharge or detain a patient against the patient's or their authorized family members' will, particularly when the basic charges are being paid and the patient or family wants to continue care or postpone discharge in particular. The \"comfort-care-only\" form you signed upholds your right to refuse aggressive treatments such as strong antibiotics, and the hospital has to honor this informed decision without coercion.Can the hospital discharge your father over your objection?The hospital cannot discharge him unilaterally just because you didn't want some treatments, particularly if he remains medically stable and basic payments are being met.If the hospital does insist on the discharge of the patient, they have to provide a \"dignified transfer\" with continuity of care, either in the patient's home or in an another facility.The hospital's argument that untreated infection can harm others does not warrant forced discharge without due medical evidence or alternative arrangements.How do you prevent or delay discharge legally?Write clearly in an email or letter your willingness to pay all the basic charges and your request for continued admission for at least 1–2 weeks to arrange care.If the hospital goes ahead with enforced discharge, you can move a habeas corpus petition for unlawful detention if they do not let him go, or go to consumer courts for violation of patient rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Injunction, court vacations, no written arguments, what to do next?",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,According to the existing law and judicial practice in Karnataka, the following are elaborate answers to your questions concerning your child custody case pending before the Family Court, Bangalore:1. If you receive a negative order on 23rd April 2025, when can you move the High Court for a stay? Do you have to wait until June 1st when courts resume or can you move the vacation bench?Right to Appeal and Stay:You are entitled to appeal the Family Court's order to the Karnataka High Court. Appeals in family cases such as custody are normally heard early in view of the sensitive nature entailing the well-being of a child.Vacation Bench Availability:Given the case at hand, you need not wait until June 1st when regular courts resume. You can instead choose to approach the vacation bench immediately after the order is delivered with a petition for stay or interim relief.Practical Steps to be taken :File the appeal and stay application at the earliest after the judgement.Seek the urgent listing prior to vacation bench on grounds of welfare of the child and after elaborating the issues of injunction .The courts usually give priority to such cases during vacations to avoid irreparable injury to the parties of the case.2. If the existing injunction against removal of the child from Bangalore is vacated, can your wife relocate the child to her hometown and enroll the child in school by June? How simple will it be to bring the child back?Effect of Vacating Injunction: If the Family Court quashes the injunction restraining removal of the child from Bangalore jurisdiction, by law your wife can move the child to her hometown.Admission to School: As mentioned after moving from Bangalore, she can further choose to enroll the child in a school there by June, as the school admission is normally on the basis of residence and guardianship.Difficulty in Bringing Child Back: It can be difficult and legally tricky to bring the child back to Bangalore after relocation. The custody orders and the child's ordinary residence are considered very crucial. You might be in a position to file a new custody petition in the new jurisdiction or file for modification of custody orders, which can be time-consuming and emotionally draining after relocation of the child3. Is it a good idea to file written arguments on the next hearing date?It is a cautious approach, particularly in sensitive cases with regard to that of child custody. Filing the written argument can be beneficial as it helps to:Present your legal and factual arguments clearly.The judge may also appreciate your side of the case fully.Maintaining the record of your submissions, which is useful in appeals or review.Improve your case and provides a positive impression on the recordTiming:As the court has listed the case for orders and no written arguments have been filed so far, filing well-written written arguments on the next date or even prior to the vacation period can positively affect the court's decision.Other Legal ConsiderationsThe courts give precedence to the child's best interest and welfare over everything else in custody cases. The Courts commonly grant interim custody or visitation rights balancing the interests of both parents, particularly during pendency of final orders.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution. The brothers should be substituted in time to prevent dismissal for non-prosecution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Who has the right to replace an unmarried litigant in an eviction case filed by him on behalf of the joint family",
    "answer": "As the eviction action pertains to a commercial shop that is joint property of the whole family (all co-sharers), the action must be prosecuted by an individual or individuals lawfully authorized to act in the joint interest of all co-sharers. Your cousin, being the only signatory and plaintiff in the suit, has died unmarried and without legal heirs (children). His interest in the property and in the suit rights falls on his legal heirs, who are his brothers, under theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended). As your cousin passed away intestate and unmarried, his legal heirs are his siblings (brothers). They inherit his share in the property and his rights in the suit. Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution. The brothers should be substituted in time to prevent dismissal for non-prosecution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it safe to buy a property where a 2010 Registered sale agreement is not canceled?",
    "answer": "It is not safe to purchase the proposed property because a litigation is pending before court in this regard, once the case filed by the land owner is disposed and if the judgment is in his favor then after the expiry of the period to prefer appeal, you can obtain a legal opinion from an experienced lawyer to proceed with the proposed purchase.You must note tht the agreement holder has given a substantial amount towards purchase of the property hence the risk is that in caase he turns up then the court may pas a verdict in his favor too because it is not barred by limitation as the land owner himself has re-activated the expired agreement by approaching the court hence the agreement gets a new period of limitation from the date of filing the suit by the landownerT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

But the risk will always be thereAn ex parte judgment will simply not come in aid as it can always be set aside.

    "question": "Frequent forcible shifting of paid allotted parking lots in the name of cultural activities",
    "answer": "As a senior citizen who has paid for an assigned open parking lot in your gated community, you have a good legal and practical ground to protest the coercive relocation of your parking lot and blocking of access during cultural events.Legal Position on Paid Parking Allotment in Gated CommunitiesWhen you pay for a particular parking space, you get a contractual right to occupy that space. This right is guaranteed under the terms of your contract with the RWA or the housing society, and it cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or changed without your prior permission. The Supreme Court rulings and RERA directives make it very clear that both the open and stilt parking areas are common areas but usage rights are distributed among the residents on payment or allotment. The allotments have to be respected by the RWA and the RWA cannot arbitrarily displace a resident's vehicle without following due process and consent of the party. RWAs are able to hold community events but in a manner that does not take away the rights of residents. Preventing the main roads from use or pushing residents to displace paid parking cars, particularly seniors who need medical attention, is tantamount to abuse of authority.Rights as a Senior Citizen and ResidentThe medical requirements and age enhance your right to free access to your vehicle. Therefore, the following action made by the RWA that hinders your quick access to your car in times of emergencies can infringe on your right to health. You have the legal right to peacefully enjoy the paid parking area without unwarranted interference or forced shifting. The RWA has to allow free passage of ambulances and emergency services at all times of the day. Therefore, keeping the main circular road closed for hours is not reasonable and can be challenged in the court.Legality of Forcible Shifting of Your VehicleMaking you move your vehicle without notice, consent, or alternative arrangement would probably be against the law. The RWA must ensure to also offer adequate alternatives. Such conduct might contravene the society's own bye-laws or the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) or equivalent state legislation applying to housing societies, which require honest and equitable management of parking.Recommended Legal ActionReference the conditions of your parking allotment and society bye-laws to ensure your rights and obligations of the RWA.Write a formal complaint to the RWA, mentioning your status as a senior citizen, medical emergency requirements, and right to paid parking. Ask them not to disturb your parking space.You can invoke provisions under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which protects senior citizens' rights to property and peaceful living.In case the RWA continues, send a legal notice via an attorney requesting the stoppage of forcible changing and hindrance.You can go to the Consumer Forum or Civil Court seeking enforcement of your rights, alleging harassment and breach of contractual rights.In case of obstruction of ambulances or emergency access, you can also lodge a police complaint for obstruction of emergency services.Record all cases of forced relocation, road blocking, and any medical emergencies arising out of delay.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your cousin, being the only signatory and plaintiff in the suit, has died unmarried and without legal heirs (children). His interest in the property and in the suit rights falls on his legal heirs, who are his brothers, under theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended). As your cousin passed away intestate and unmarried, his legal heirs are his siblings (brothers). They inherit his share in the property and his rights in the suit. Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution.

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Who has the right to replace an unmarried litigant in an eviction case filed by him on behalf of the joint family",
    "answer": "As the eviction action pertains to a commercial shop that is joint property of the whole family (all co-sharers), the action must be prosecuted by an individual or individuals lawfully authorized to act in the joint interest of all co-sharers. Your cousin, being the only signatory and plaintiff in the suit, has died unmarried and without legal heirs (children). His interest in the property and in the suit rights falls on his legal heirs, who are his brothers, under theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended). As your cousin passed away intestate and unmarried, his legal heirs are his siblings (brothers). They inherit his share in the property and his rights in the suit. Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution. The brothers should be substituted in time to prevent dismissal for non-prosecution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Who has the right to replace an unmarried litigant in an eviction case filed by him on behalf of the joint family",
    "answer": "As the eviction action pertains to a commercial shop that is joint property of the whole family (all co-sharers), the action must be prosecuted by an individual or individuals lawfully authorized to act in the joint interest of all co-sharers. Your cousin, being the only signatory and plaintiff in the suit, has died unmarried and without legal heirs (children). His interest in the property and in the suit rights falls on his legal heirs, who are his brothers, under theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (as amended). As your cousin passed away intestate and unmarried, his legal heirs are his siblings (brothers). They inherit his share in the property and his rights in the suit. Hence, only his siblings have the legal right to be substituted in his stead in the eviction suit. Other co-sharers like cousins or uncles do not inherit the share of the deceased cousin and therefore cannot replace him as a party in the suit. They remain co-plaintiffs or co-sharers in their own right but cannot occupy the shoes of the deceased litigant. Brothers of the late cousin should approach the court of the first instance by filing an application for substitution of the late party under Rule 3 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) accompanied by evidence of their succession as legal heirs (family tree, succession certificate, or otherwise).If your cousin was the sole plaintiff (single signatory) in the suit, the suit cannot proceed without substitution. The brothers should be substituted in time to prevent dismissal for non-prosecution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child custody",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing the detailed background. Your case involves sensitive and critical issues ofchild custody,jurisdiction, andthe welfare of a minor, which Indian courts treat with utmost priority. Let me address your queries one by one withclarity and practical advice:1. Can this case be expedited or transferred to High Court?Yes, it can. Since the matter pertains to the custody of aminor child, you can file awrit petition or transfer petitionbefore the Hon’ble High Court underArticle 227 of theConstitution of Indiato seek expeditious hearing or direct intervention.Courts are generally receptive to such prayers, especially whencustody-related delaysare causing hardship to the child.In addition, you can move anapplication for early hearingin the family court as an interim relief, supported by valid grounds like schooling, documentation delays, etc.2. Will the Court consider your son’s opinion (he’s now 12)?Yes, absolutely. Indian courts, particularly underGuardians and Wards ActandHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, do take theopinion of a minor above 9 yearsinto account—provided the child is mature enough to understand the situation.However, it is notbinding—it’s one of the factors.If there is influence or coaching from any side (e.g., paternal family), the court can directchild counselingor interaction with theChild Welfare Committee (CWC)or aCourt-appointed Counselor.3. How to expedite the case legally?To fast-track the process:File aninterlocutory applicationin the family court forearly disposalor priority listing.Alternatively, approach theHigh Courtvia writ jurisdiction fordirections to the family court to conclude the matter within a time-bound period.You may also mention your difficulty in applying forpassport, Aadhaar, or visadue to the pending case, making it a compelling ground for urgency.4. How much weight does the Court give to child’s opinion?The Court always prioritizes“the best interest of the child”over mere preferences. If the father’s household has past instability (remarriages, divorce), and if the child is in astable, nurturing environmentunder your parents, it worksin your favour.The court will consider factors like:Schooling, routines, emotional bondingYour financial capability and international opportunitiesChild’s safety, moral environment, and future stability5. Approximate cost to fight the case in High Court?Acustody-related writ or transfer petitionin High Court can range from ₹75,000 to ₹1,50,000 depending on the complexity, urgency, and the lawyer’s experience.However, I tailor my professional chargesbased on your circumstancesand ensurecomplete end-to-end support, including representation, drafting, and follow-ups.6. Chances of High Court accepting your matter?Verystrong, provided the documentation is proper and the petition clearly shows:Undue delayin lower courtImpact on your son’s rights and developmentLegal hurdles in gettingpassport or visaYourCanadian citizenshipand genuine intent to raise your child in a stable environmentHigh Courts interveneespecially when lower courts show delay or when minors’ future is compromised.✅ Why Engage Me?I specialize incomplex family law matters, particularly involvingNRI/OCI parents.I can ensurestrategic representation, solid drafting, andcourtroom advocacy.I will guide you onhow to present your son’s best interest,gather supporting documents, and managepassport and visa documentationlegally.We can set up apaid consultation over a call or Zoomat your convenience where I’ll review the court papers and plan your next legal move in detail.Please feel free to reach out on WhatsApp atNINE FIVE NINE TWO FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO SIX EIGHTto schedule a discussion.Warm regards,Advocate, Punjab & Haryana High Court📍 Based in ChandigarhSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Misspelling in father’s middle name on marriage registration",
    "answer": "Correcting the Name on the Marriage CertificateThe Correction Procedure: Indian marriage certificates can be updated or in the said case may be corrected by making an application to the local marriage registrar office in which the marriage was being registered. This is normally done by through the process of submitting an application together with an evidence of the correct name (like the father's Aadhaar card, PAN card, or passport) and an affidavit stating the reason for the error of the same.The Physical Presence Requirement: Majority of the state marriage registrar offices demand that the applicant or at least one of the parties must be physically present for verification, thumb impression, and witness authentication. This is a standard procedure and a protocol in order to avoid fraud.Limitations in Online Application: Although marriage registration applications can be started online in most states, corrections generally need offline submission and personal verification at the registrar's office.If You Are Unable to Be Present Physically in IndiaYou may sign a Power of Attorney in the US naming a reliable relative, friend, or a legal practitioner in India to represent you to file the correction application and formalities at the registrar's office.A notarized affidavit from wife or the authorized person might be required wherein they are required to explain the error and request the correction. Along with that supporting identity documents of the party will also be necessary.Contact the marriage registrar office or local municipal corporation where the marriage was registered to confirm the exact documents and process for correction via PoA, by fulfilling the conditions.Impact on Immigration PetitionMinor misspelling in the marriage certificate, particularly in a relative's name (such as the father's middle name), usually will not make much difference in immigration petitions, as long as the marriage certificate is genuine and valid. You may present an affidavit or a notarized letter stating the misspelling along with the original certificate. Immigration officials generally accept such clarifications as long as the misspelling is slight and does not impact the identities of the parties. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the correction be undertaken prior to the filing of the immigration petition so that no delay or request for supplemental evidence is encountered from immigration officials. A notarized affidavit documenting the mistake and confirming the proper name can serve to temporarily clear up the situation for immigration purposes. A notary document, however, does not substitute for the official change on the marriage certificate. It is a corroborating document, not a replacement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Manual Challan Procedure:Schools often issue a “manual challan” when fees are paid offline (by cash, demand draft, or bank transfer). This challan should detail each fee component (tuition, bus fee, etc.). However, many schools use digital portals that combine all fees, and there’s no statutory mandate requiring them to split components.What You Can Request:Ask the school management to provide a revised fee invoice (or manual challan) that clearly shows tuition and bus charges separately.If they refuse, send a formal email stating that you will only authorize payment for tuition fees (with corresponding bank transfer records showing the breakdown in the narration).Alternatives & Record Keeping:Use traceable bank transfers where you clearly note “Tuition Fee – [Term]” as the payment purpose.Retain all emails and transfer receipts to document that you paid the tuition fee.If the dispute escalates, consider involving the education authority or filing an application in family court to get clarity on fee sharing.These steps help protect you legally and show your intent to pay only the appropriate component while discouraging further disputes."

    "answer": "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution.Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options underHindu Marriage Lawandchild custody principles, tailored to your concerns:🔹1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal?Yes.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedingseven if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as:Mental cruelty and incompatibility(Section 13(1)(ia))Breakdown of marriagewith no chance of reconciliationEven though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you fromseeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally.🔹2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights?In family courts,child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always:🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?”Unless it is proven that you arean unfit or abusive parent, yourpast personal relationshipwillnot automatically disqualify youfrom having custody or visitation rights.Also:Merephotos, chats, and hotel bookingsmay suggest a relationship, butmay not be enough to conclusively prove adulteryin court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions.⚖️Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child.🔹3. Types of Custody You Can SeekYou can claim any of the following:Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minorJoint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the fatherVisitation rights, if shared parenting is possibleThe court also looks into:Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years)Stability and emotional comfort of the homeEducation and upbringing environment✅ You can also seekinterim custodyduring the case andmaintenance for the childunder Section125 CrPCor Guardians and Wards Act.🔹4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take NowHere’s what I recommend as your next move:✅1. Start with Consultation & Case StrategyWe’ll draft your divorce petition based onmental crueltyand irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds.✅2. File for Custody SimultaneouslyIn the same family court, you can requestinterim custody and permanent custodyof your child.✅3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and HisWe’ll organize your records ofhis mental tortureand prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance.✅4. Mediation OptionYou can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma.📌 Final WordYou have thefull right to exit a toxic marriage, andcourts will not ignore your role as a motherbased on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally.Would you like me to assist you with:Drafting yourdivorce and custody petitionHandling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process)Setting up aconfidential legal strategyto protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?Feel free to message or WhatsApp me directly atNine Five Nine Two Five Zero Zero Zero Six Eightfor a completely private consultation.

    "context": "Asked 1 month ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce in Your CaseMental cruelty on the part of the husband is a good ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. As you have suffered mental torture for 8 years, you can seek divorce on this ground. Your extramarital affair, though mentioned by your husband, is not a criminal act (adultery was legalized in India in 2018) but can be used as a reason for divorce. It will not exclude you from divorce.2. Child Custody IssuesAs your daughter is 5 years old, courts always like to give custody to the mother unless there are serious circumstances impairing the well-being of the child. Significantly, adultery or marital infidelity by a parent alone does not bar them from obtaining custody. Courts are most concerned with the child's well-being and whether or not the parent can ensure the child a secure and loving home. The court will take into account factors such as your capability to take care of the child, the child's ease and overall well-being and not your moral evaluation of your own personal life.3. Regarding the Evidence of AdulteryChats, pictures, and hotel bookings can be used as circumstantial evidence of adultery, but adultery is no longer a criminal act. It can be considered as a reason for divorce but won't necessarily impact the custody rights unless it damages the welfare of the child. Your husband can attempt to bring this evidence before the court, but the court will distinguish between the issues of adultery and custody.4. Removing the Child from the Home of the Marital CoupleIf you are being mentally tortured and your husband is not permitting you to go out, you can take refuge under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA), where you can obtain protection orders and residence orders so that you remain safe. You can go to the police or a women's helpline for instant help and protection. Legally speaking, you can't simply go out of the house with the child without a court order or informing her or him because the two parents equally have rights to the child. But your daughter being less than 7, courts would predominantly give the mother custody. To prevent legal issues, approach the family court and file a petition for custody and protection orders prior to moving out. In case you move out without notice, your husband may accuse you of kidnapping, which will create problems.5. Practically How to ProceedFile a divorce petition on the grounds of cruelty in the family court. At the same time, file a custody petition for your daughter, highlighting her well-being and your capability to take care of her. File a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct to obtain protection orders for harassment and mental torture by your husband. Approach local women's helplines or NGOs for immediate protection and legal assistance. Do not confront or leave the house suddenly without legal protection to avoid charges of kidnapping or contempt of court.Dealing with Your Fear That Husband Will Contact the Other ManYour husband will attempt to get the other man into court for proving adultery, but this will not impact your rights to custody except that it has been proven that your relationship is detrimental to the welfare of the child. Emphasize your case on your mental torture and your capacity to provide a secure environment to your daughter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"
