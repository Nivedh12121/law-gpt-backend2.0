    "question": "Is it possible to remove kul if tenant has not paid any rent for last 15y and now not removing kul",
    "answer": "Tenanted property (kul Kayada) means your forefathers (ancestors) had leased /given the land to other persons to cultivate and in turn they were getting rent for it.After Independence, various land reform acts were enacted for equitable distribution of the land and accordingly Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act 1948 is one of them. The objective of the act is \"land to the tillers\". Those persons who are lawfully cultivating the land of others are considered as a deemed tenant under the act. The said act  declared 1 April 1957 as a tillers day and persons who are tenant or cultivating the land of others  on 1 April 1957 (tillers day)are deemed to have purchased land. Thus, Kul Kayada is a provision of protection given to the tenants of the land under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Act 1948. U/s 43 of the said Act any land acquired by a tenant shall not be entitled to be sold, transferred without the prior approval of the Collector.The main purpose of Section 43 is that itensures the protection of the persons belonging to the disadvantaged agricultural groups and gives them the right of purchase upon them.If tenant is not cultivating land personally he can be removed by following procedure laid down under BTAL act"

    "question": "Is it possible to remove kul if tenant has not paid any rent for last 15y and now not removing kul",
    "answer": "Tenanted property (kul Kayada) means your forefathers (ancestors) had leased /given the land to other persons to cultivate and in turn they were getting rent for it.After Independence, various land reform acts were enacted for equitable distribution of the land and accordingly Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act 1948 is one of them. The objective of the act is \"land to the tillers\". Those persons who are lawfully cultivating the land of others are considered as a deemed tenant under the act. The said act  declared 1 April 1957 as a tillers day and persons who are tenant or cultivating the land of others  on 1 April 1957 (tillers day)are deemed to have purchased land. Thus, Kul Kayada is a provision of protection given to the tenants of the land under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Act 1948. U/s 43 of the said Act any land acquired by a tenant shall not be entitled to be sold, transferred without the prior approval of the Collector.The main purpose of Section 43 is that itensures the protection of the persons belonging to the disadvantaged agricultural groups and gives them the right of purchase upon them.If tenant is not cultivating land personally he can be removed by following procedure laid down under BTAL act"

    "answer": "Tenanted property (kul Kayada) means your forefathers (ancestors) had leased /given the land to other persons to cultivate and in turn they were getting rent for it.After Independence, various land reform acts were enacted for equitable distribution of the land and accordingly Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act 1948 is one of them. The objective of the act is \"land to the tillers\". Those persons who are lawfully cultivating the land of others are considered as a deemed tenant under the act. The said act  declared 1 April 1957 as a tillers day and persons who are tenant or cultivating the land of others  on 1 April 1957 (tillers day)are deemed to have purchased land. Thus, Kul Kayada is a provision of protection given to the tenants of the land under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Act 1948. U/s 43 of the said Act any land acquired by a tenant shall not be entitled to be sold, transferred without the prior approval of the Collector.The main purpose of Section 43 is that itensures the protection of the persons belonging to the disadvantaged agricultural groups and gives them the right of purchase upon them.If tenant is not cultivating land personally he can be removed by following procedure laid down under BTAL act"

    "answer": "1. if the original member [now deceased] had left a nomination, then LA is not required2. the society can directly transfer the share certificate to the names of the joint nominees3. as regards the transfer forms to be submitted, you can ask the society to give you a copy which you can then make on the required stamp paper and submit4. it needs to be noted that transfer of shares to the name of the nominee would not confer any title in favour of the nominees5. the nominees would be holding the flat as trustees for the other legal heirs of the deceased member, provided there are any other legal heirs, aside from the children6. i do not understand the insistence of the society for a LA when there is a nomination registered in respect of the subject flat7. not having the LA will not come in the way of the redevelopment since transferring the shares to the names of the nominees would not legally affect both the society and the developer who will be redeveloping the property8. however sooner or later the nominees [provided they are the only surviving legal heirs of the deceased member] would have to apply for a LA so that proper title of the flat in transferred to their names.9. release deed will come into play when one legal heir is surrendering or giving up his share and right to other legal heir.

    "question": "Joint family property issue",
    "answer": "1.  If the property belonged to joint family then it will come under HUF, in that case a single person cannot get any share in the property by a gift deed executed by another member of the HUF.The properties under HUF belong to all the members of the HUF equally hence the transfer of property by executing gift deed in favor your daughter by your son ignoring the rights of other members of the HUF is not legally maintainable, hence the aggrieved persons can file a suit for partition and claim their legitimate rights and shares in the proeprty even at this stage ignoring the fact of this gift deed.2. If the relinquishment deed made is required to be cancelled then it should be done within three years from the date of execution, since your case is barred by limitation, it may not be maintainable at this stage.3. You can file a suit for partition claiming your rightful share in the property if you are not a party to the gift deed and the release deed.You cannot fight for others rights.4. You can file an injunction petition restraining her from alienating or encumbering the property further in any manner till the disposal of the partition suit that you propose to file now.5. If you want to have a proper and legally valid solution to the problem that you are facing now, it is advisable that you approach court with a suit for partition and other ancillary reliefs, unless you will not be able to bring peace into your home, all these issues will keep developing without any solution forever.Further questions:1.  you can decide about claiming your rights in all the properties or only in some of the particular properties, there is no compulsion on you about it.2.

    "question": "Joint family property issue",
    "answer": "1.  If the property belonged to joint family then it will come under HUF, in that case a single person cannot get any share in the property by a gift deed executed by another member of the HUF.The properties under HUF belong to all the members of the HUF equally hence the transfer of property by executing gift deed in favor your daughter by your son ignoring the rights of other members of the HUF is not legally maintainable, hence the aggrieved persons can file a suit for partition and claim their legitimate rights and shares in the proeprty even at this stage ignoring the fact of this gift deed.2. If the relinquishment deed made is required to be cancelled then it should be done within three years from the date of execution, since your case is barred by limitation, it may not be maintainable at this stage.3. You can file a suit for partition claiming your rightful share in the property if you are not a party to the gift deed and the release deed.You cannot fight for others rights.4. You can file an injunction petition restraining her from alienating or encumbering the property further in any manner till the disposal of the partition suit that you propose to file now.5. If you want to have a proper and legally valid solution to the problem that you are facing now, it is advisable that you approach court with a suit for partition and other ancillary reliefs, unless you will not be able to bring peace into your home, all these issues will keep developing without any solution forever.Further questions:1.  you can decide about claiming your rights in all the properties or only in some of the particular properties, there is no compulsion on you about it.2. Yes, in your written statement you can make a claim to your legitimate share in the said properties as a right.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce of UK citizen to Indian girl",
    "answer": "First of all it is not legal and justified on your part to get your brother suffering from mental ill health conditions married a girl, if the girl side turn the table on your side that you have suppressed the fact of his mental health status, then it can be an offence under criminal law for cheating and breach of trust and many other offences  related to this situation. Whatever, since the marriage has been solemnised suppressing the fact material to marriage, it can be considered as void marriage hence it can be annulled by filing an application from her side.Secondly, the marriage performed before  Arya samaj is not considered as legally valid especially if the groom is a foreign citizen and the bride is a resident India.  The marriage registered under special marriage only shall be considered as legally valid marriage.Thirdly, the marriage is solemnised underhindu marriage actamong other vital reasons is for procreation, which is also a vital reason. If your brother is incapable of offering conjugal relationship then there is no purpose of this marriage and can be annulled due to his impotency.If the marriage is annulled for the above said reasons, then there is no marriage at all between them, therefore she will not become eligible for alimony or maintenance, however to avenge this, she may file other criminal cases agaisnt the entire family of the bride groom.Therefore to avoid unnecessary legal complications and stretched legal battles, it is advisable tht you enter into a compromise on negotiated terms and settle the matter out of court and get the marriage dissolved by amutual consent divorceafter completion of one year after the marriage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "First of all it is not legal and justified on your part to get your brother suffering from mental ill health conditions married a girl, if the girl side turn the table on your side that you have suppressed the fact of his mental health status, then it can be an offence under criminal law for cheating and breach of trust and many other offences  related to this situation. Whatever, since the marriage has been solemnised suppressing the fact material to marriage, it can be considered as void marriage hence it can be annulled by filing an application from her side.Secondly, the marriage performed before  Arya samaj is not considered as legally valid especially if the groom is a foreign citizen and the bride is a resident India.  The marriage registered under special marriage only shall be considered as legally valid marriage.Thirdly, the marriage is solemnised underhindu marriage actamong other vital reasons is for procreation, which is also a vital reason. If your brother is incapable of offering conjugal relationship then there is no purpose of this marriage and can be annulled due to his impotency.If the marriage is annulled for the above said reasons, then there is no marriage at all between them, therefore she will not become eligible for alimony or maintenance, however to avenge this, she may file other criminal cases agaisnt the entire family of the bride groom.Therefore to avoid unnecessary legal complications and stretched legal battles, it is advisable tht you enter into a compromise on negotiated terms and settle the matter out of court and get the marriage dissolved by amutual consent divorceafter completion of one year after the marriage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Whether you got converted to Hindu or not, being a foreign citizen, your marriage should have been registered under the provisions ofSpecial marriage actonly and not underHindu marriage act.Therefore basically the marriage is invalid in India itself.Secondly, if your marriage was dissolved by a decree of divorce by the USA court on the grounds of cruelty, which is a legally valid ground for divorce in India, then this divorce decree is recognised as valid, hence you do not have to be concerned about the validity in India.You may have to ensure that the divorce is granted on the grounds of cruelty by the court in USA instead of fault or no fault divorce, which is the usual phenomenon in USA.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

There no procedure under Indian law to validate a divorce which is valid by itself. It sufficient if the divorce satisfies condition of Section 13 and 14. Any proceeding seeking validation of valid divorce will be taken as you are admitting that the divorce is not valid, it will nullify you valid divorce from  U.S. Court.You needs to just produce the decree of divorce to the authorities (judicial/executive).

Whatever, since the marriage has been solemnised suppressing the fact material to marriage, it can be considered as void marriage hence it can be annulled by filing an application from her side.Secondly, the marriage performed before  Arya samaj is not considered as legally valid especially if the groom is a foreign citizen and the bride is a resident India.  The marriage registered under special marriage only shall be considered as legally valid marriage.Thirdly, the marriage is solemnised underhindu marriage actamong other vital reasons is for procreation, which is also a vital reason. If your brother is incapable of offering conjugal relationship then there is no purpose of this marriage and can be annulled due to his impotency.If the marriage is annulled for the above said reasons, then there is no marriage at all between them, therefore she will not become eligible for alimony or maintenance, however to avenge this, she may file other criminal cases agaisnt the entire family of the bride groom.Therefore to avoid unnecessary legal complications and stretched legal battles, it is advisable tht you enter into a compromise on negotiated terms and settle the matter out of court and get the marriage dissolved by amutual consent divorceafter completion of one year after the marriage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "According to Section 54EC, a taxpayer's capital gains are not subject to taxation if they are invested in \"long-term defined assets\" within six months of the sale of a long-term capital asset, such as an immovable property or stocks and shares. The term \"long-term specified assets\" refers to government-notified bonds and securities, such as those issued by the Rural Electrification Corporation and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (REC).However, you cannot invest more than Rs. 50 lakhs in these bonds in total. If your total capital gains are higher than Rs. 50 lakhs, you may also want to build a house and avail the benefits of Sections 54 or 54F instead of buying bonds under Section 54EC.

    "question": "Divorce of UK citizen to Indian girl",
    "answer": "First of all it is not legal and justified on your part to get your brother suffering from mental ill health conditions married a girl, if the girl side turn the table on your side that you have suppressed the fact of his mental health status, then it can be an offence under criminal law for cheating and breach of trust and many other offences  related to this situation. Whatever, since the marriage has been solemnised suppressing the fact material to marriage, it can be considered as void marriage hence it can be annulled by filing an application from her side.Secondly, the marriage performed before  Arya samaj is not considered as legally valid especially if the groom is a foreign citizen and the bride is a resident India.  The marriage registered under special marriage only shall be considered as legally valid marriage.Thirdly, the marriage is solemnised underhindu marriage actamong other vital reasons is for procreation, which is also a vital reason. If your brother is incapable of offering conjugal relationship then there is no purpose of this marriage and can be annulled due to his impotency.If the marriage is annulled for the above said reasons, then there is no marriage at all between them, therefore she will not become eligible for alimony or maintenance, however to avenge this, she may file other criminal cases agaisnt the entire family of the bride groom.Therefore to avoid unnecessary legal complications and stretched legal battles, it is advisable tht you enter into a compromise on negotiated terms and settle the matter out of court and get the marriage dissolved by amutual consent divorceafter completion of one year after the marriage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Whatever, since the marriage has been solemnised suppressing the fact material to marriage, it can be considered as void marriage hence it can be annulled by filing an application from her side.Secondly, the marriage performed before  Arya samaj is not considered as legally valid especially if the groom is a foreign citizen and the bride is a resident India.  The marriage registered under special marriage only shall be considered as legally valid marriage.Thirdly, the marriage is solemnised underhindu marriage actamong other vital reasons is for procreation, which is also a vital reason. If your brother is incapable of offering conjugal relationship then there is no purpose of this marriage and can be annulled due to his impotency.If the marriage is annulled for the above said reasons, then there is no marriage at all between them, therefore she will not become eligible for alimony or maintenance, however to avenge this, she may file other criminal cases agaisnt the entire family of the bride groom.Therefore to avoid unnecessary legal complications and stretched legal battles, it is advisable tht you enter into a compromise on negotiated terms and settle the matter out of court and get the marriage dissolved by amutual consent divorceafter completion of one year after the marriage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Whatever, since the marriage has been solemnised suppressing the fact material to marriage, it can be considered as void marriage hence it can be annulled by filing an application from her side.Secondly, the marriage performed before  Arya samaj is not considered as legally valid especially if the groom is a foreign citizen and the bride is a resident India.  The marriage registered under special marriage only shall be considered as legally valid marriage.Thirdly, the marriage is solemnised underhindu marriage actamong other vital reasons is for procreation, which is also a vital reason. If your brother is incapable of offering conjugal relationship then there is no purpose of this marriage and can be annulled due to his impotency.If the marriage is annulled for the above said reasons, then there is no marriage at all between them, therefore she will not become eligible for alimony or maintenance, however to avenge this, she may file other criminal cases agaisnt the entire family of the bride groom.Therefore to avoid unnecessary legal complications and stretched legal battles, it is advisable tht you enter into a compromise on negotiated terms and settle the matter out of court and get the marriage dissolved by amutual consent divorceafter completion of one year after the marriage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1. The divorce case filed by her in court situated in Kuwait was dismissed for default which   confirms her legal status that she still remains legally married to you.Therefore in order to get your marriage dissolved by a court of law, you may better approach an Indian court with a petition  for divorce on the grounds of cruelty.That would benefit you because the exparte divorce obtained in Kuwait is not legally valid or recognised in India.2. The case was filed by the opposite side and it was dismissed for default, it means for non-prosecution of the case filed by her.Therefore there is no logic in your lawyer's opinion to reopen the dismissed case.Instead you can file a fresh case and get an exparte decree, of course it may not be recognised as legally valid in  India for the marriage solemnised in  India.3.

    "question": "Can the director be convicted without the company being convicted under section 138/141 of NI Act?",
    "answer": "Hi,since company is itself a corporate body, separate legal entity and the signatories being the directors, cannot be accused of if the company is not convicted for the offence.in a chattisgarh HC, the court held that- \"referring back to the allegations and averments made in the complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, though the petitioners have been described somewhere in the petition as Director in some petition for and on behalf of *** Industries Limited would make it clear that the respondents were in know of the fact that with whom they are dealing. The copy of the cheques which are produced in few of the cases would also show that the cheques were issued on behalf of the company not in the individual capacity of the petitioners. Consequently, in the complaint when the company has not been arrayed as accused, the prosecution simplicitor against the Director without making specific averments about the role played by them would not be maintainable.\"Also, in a 2012 case, the SC HELD TAHT:\"Applying the doctrine of strict construction, we are of the considered opinion that commission of offence by the company is an express condition precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others. Thus, the words “as well as the company” appearing in the Section make it absolutely unmistakably clear that when the company can be prosecuted, then only the persons mentioned in the other categories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to the averments in the petition and proof thereof. One cannot be oblivious of the fact that the company is a juristic person, and it has its own respectability. If a finding is recorded against it, it would create a concavity in its reputation. There can be situations when the corporate reputation is affected when a director is indicted.\"you can any day file an appeal against the order/judgement.thanks.Riti GuptaAdvocate, Mohali16 AnswersTalk to Advocate Riti Gupta"

    "answer": "The company is supposed to know generally as to who were in-charge of the affairs of the company.The company is expected to allege that the persons named in the complaint are in-charge of the affairs of the company.The burden would be on the board of directors or persons in-charge of the affairs of the company to show that they are not liable to be convicted.The reasons for this that only the directors of the company have special knowledge of the role that they play in the company. The existence of any special circumstance that makes them not liable is something that is particularly within their knowledge and it is for them to establish in the trial to show that at the relevant point in time they were not in-charge of the affairs of the company.You can refer to SP Mani & Mohan Diary Vs.

Procedurally, you are entitled for a copy of the chargesheet by the court after you are summoned on your first appearance. You don't need to appear without summons as the process may include the complainant or the prosecution filing the protest petition. Once you are summoned you have to appear alongwith your lawyer and you will be given a copy of chargesheet free of cost.2. First part of the query has been answered above. You will be admitted on bail after your appearance. You don't need to apply for any anticipatory bail. It is the bail granted by the court on your appearance alongwith the surety.3. If you violate the bail condition, or do not appear Bailable warrants are issued, but they are subject to cancellation on your appearance or moving appropriate application.I hope your queries are answered.

Procedurally, you are entitled for a copy of the chargesheet by the court after you are summoned on your first appearance. You don't need to appear without summons as the process may include the complainant or the prosecution filing the protest petition. Once you are summoned you have to appear alongwith your lawyer and you will be given a copy of chargesheet free of cost.2. First part of the query has been answered above. You will be admitted on bail after your appearance. You don't need to apply for any anticipatory bail. It is the bail granted by the court on your appearance alongwith the surety.3. If you violate the bail condition, or do not appear Bailable warrants are issued, but they are subject to cancellation on your appearance or moving appropriate application.I hope your queries are answered.

    "answer": "The question of HUF property arises only if it is a joint Hindu family which has been in common possession and enjoyment of all the coparceners for generations together and has not been partitioned. Your father's estate is not ancestral as you say he had inherited it (as his absolute and exclusive share). After your father's death, his estate devolves upon all his legal heirs equally, you and your brothers, sisters, mother and grandmother (father's mother). You cannot be legally recognised as a 'karta'.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

You don't need to appear without summons as the process may include the complainant or the prosecution filing the protest petition. Once you are summoned you have to appear alongwith your lawyer and you will be given a copy of chargesheet free of cost.2. First part of the query has been answered above. You will be admitted on bail after your appearance. You don't need to apply for any anticipatory bail. It is the bail granted by the court on your appearance alongwith the surety.3. If you violate the bail condition, or do not appear Bailable warrants are issued, but they are subject to cancellation on your appearance or moving appropriate application.I hope your queries are answered.

    "answer": "the steps to be followed are as below -1. first sign and register a release deed2. apply for an heirship certificate. if you are applying for an heirship certificate then no need to apply for a letters of administration. so you can either go for an heirship certificate or a LOA. The former is more quicker than the latter. in a petition for grant of heirship certificate the court will declare the surviving legal heirs of the deceased. whereas in the petition for grant of LOA the court will appoint an administrator from among the legal heirs of the deceased, who can administer the estate of the deceased and transfer the properties to the legal heirs as per law. the purpose of both the petitions is the same - which is to give a valid legal discharge to any person who would deal with the holder of the heirship certificate or with the holder of the LOA3. once the heirship certificate is granted, you can submit that alongwith the registered release deed to the society for mutating the share certificate to enter the name of the mother in the society's records4. the above steps will complete the title of your mother to the propertyYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Procedurally, you are entitled for a copy of the chargesheet by the court after you are summoned on your first appearance. You don't need to appear without summons as the process may include the complainant or the prosecution filing the protest petition. Once you are summoned you have to appear alongwith your lawyer and you will be given a copy of chargesheet free of cost.2. First part of the query has been answered above. You will be admitted on bail after your appearance. You don't need to apply for any anticipatory bail. It is the bail granted by the court on your appearance alongwith the surety.3. If you violate the bail condition, or do not appear Bailable warrants are issued, but they are subject to cancellation on your appearance or moving appropriate application.I hope your queries are answered.

    "answer": "Hi,since company is itself a corporate body, separate legal entity and the signatories being the directors, cannot be accused of if the company is not convicted for the offence.in a chattisgarh HC, the court held that- \"referring back to the allegations and averments made in the complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, though the petitioners have been described somewhere in the petition as Director in some petition for and on behalf of *** Industries Limited would make it clear that the respondents were in know of the fact that with whom they are dealing. The copy of the cheques which are produced in few of the cases would also show that the cheques were issued on behalf of the company not in the individual capacity of the petitioners. Consequently, in the complaint when the company has not been arrayed as accused, the prosecution simplicitor against the Director without making specific averments about the role played by them would not be maintainable.\"Also, in a 2012 case, the SC HELD TAHT:\"Applying the doctrine of strict construction, we are of the considered opinion that commission of offence by the company is an express condition precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others. Thus, the words “as well as the company” appearing in the Section make it absolutely unmistakably clear that when the company can be prosecuted, then only the persons mentioned in the other categories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to the averments in the petition and proof thereof. One cannot be oblivious of the fact that the company is a juristic person, and it has its own respectability. If a finding is recorded against it, it would create a concavity in its reputation. There can be situations when the corporate reputation is affected when a director is indicted.\"you can any day file an appeal against the order/judgement.thanks.Riti GuptaAdvocate, Mohali16 AnswersTalk to Advocate Riti Gupta"

    "answer": "1. The divorce case filed by her in court situated in Kuwait was dismissed for default which   confirms her legal status that she still remains legally married to you.Therefore in order to get your marriage dissolved by a court of law, you may better approach an Indian court with a petition  for divorce on the grounds of cruelty.That would benefit you because the exparte divorce obtained in Kuwait is not legally valid or recognised in India.2. The case was filed by the opposite side and it was dismissed for default, it means for non-prosecution of the case filed by her.Therefore there is no logic in your lawyer's opinion to reopen the dismissed case.Instead you can file a fresh case and get an exparte decree, of course it may not be recognised as legally valid in  India for the marriage solemnised in  India.3.

    "answer": "Hi,since company is itself a corporate body, separate legal entity and the signatories being the directors, cannot be accused of if the company is not convicted for the offence.in a chattisgarh HC, the court held that- \"referring back to the allegations and averments made in the complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, though the petitioners have been described somewhere in the petition as Director in some petition for and on behalf of *** Industries Limited would make it clear that the respondents were in know of the fact that with whom they are dealing. The copy of the cheques which are produced in few of the cases would also show that the cheques were issued on behalf of the company not in the individual capacity of the petitioners. Consequently, in the complaint when the company has not been arrayed as accused, the prosecution simplicitor against the Director without making specific averments about the role played by them would not be maintainable.\"Also, in a 2012 case, the SC HELD TAHT:\"Applying the doctrine of strict construction, we are of the considered opinion that commission of offence by the company is an express condition precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others. Thus, the words “as well as the company” appearing in the Section make it absolutely unmistakably clear that when the company can be prosecuted, then only the persons mentioned in the other categories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to the averments in the petition and proof thereof. One cannot be oblivious of the fact that the company is a juristic person, and it has its own respectability. If a finding is recorded against it, it would create a concavity in its reputation. There can be situations when the corporate reputation is affected when a director is indicted.\"you can any day file an appeal against the order/judgement.thanks.Riti GuptaAdvocate, Mohali16 AnswersTalk to Advocate Riti Gupta"

    "answer": "Section 202 empowers Magistrate to postpone issue of summons to accused until be directs investigation by police or himself inquires in to the complaint as any offence  is made out or not. Magistrate  is in doubt whether any offence  is made out or not.Having once approached High Court and the High Court having declined to quash FIR, there is very bleak possibility that their petition will be entertained.They can certainly approach High Court for quash of fresh complaint underSection 406, 418 and 420 as it is an after thought.  Complaint is filed to compensate for dropping of charges.Ingredients of offence under Section 376 and 307 are distinct fromSection 498A. The complainant being wife, quash will not be entertained by High Court.Grounds of jurisdiction in 498A is not available now, as law laid down in Jacob v. Inspector Police is overruled by SC now.You have good case for quash of 420 complaint.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "376, 307 charges dropped in chargesheet submission and to harass us new complaint filed u/s 420",
    "answer": "Section 202 Cr.p.c.  states thus:Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under section 192, may, if he thinks fit and shall in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he exercises his jurisdiction, postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding;1.  The high court already has passed the order dismissing the quash petition for the reasons shown therein, however since the complaint is once again made afresh it will be a new case to which the proposed quash is sought, but it should be pleaded on merits and not on the jurisdictional point of view because the previous judgment is very clear about the jurisdictional aspect.2. High court may not entertain any fresh quash petition on the same grounds just because the charges under other sections were dropped.In fact the plea taken over the jurisdictional point of view seeking to quash the FIR may not be entertained because the case is at the preliminary stage only, if the charge sheet is filed after investigation and you find any lacuna in the investigation or feel that the charges are false then you can file a quash petition to quash the charge sheet on the basis of the contents of the charge sheet alone and not o the jurisdictional point of view, because the investigation has been conducted by the agency and has submitted their final report, therefore the court which is taking cognizance of the offence can be an additional adverse inference over your plea of jurisdictional point.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If it is not resolved then he might ask for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the advocate on the Vakalatnama or on other documents related to the case.There may be cases when the advocate does not agree to give a NOC, then the person can issue a notice of termination to the advocate and apply to the court for withdrawal of Vakalatnama.3) Peruse the forum record and if you find it that lying with record then file an application for return of the original document. On the other hand document kept with the lawyer then lodge a complaint to the local Bar Association and Bar council.Thank youAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If you plan to change your lawyer for the purpose of fees alone, then it would be more costlier to you by engaging the services of new lawyer, you may have to pay the fee from the scratch to the new lawyer.You can better negotiate the fee aspect with the existing lawyer if this is the only issue you face.2. You can request the lawyer to give NOC to engage a new lawyer, or you can issue a notice to him mentioning that you have terminated the vakalatnama given to him.3.If he refuses, you can approach court by filing a memo stating that you have terminated the vakalatnama given to the current lawyer and have decided to engage another lawyer afresh to handle your case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The former is more quicker than the latter. in a petition for grant of heirship certificate the court will declare the surviving legal heirs of the deceased. whereas in the petition for grant of LOA the court will appoint an administrator from among the legal heirs of the deceased, who can administer the estate of the deceased and transfer the properties to the legal heirs as per law. the purpose of both the petitions is the same - which is to give a valid legal discharge to any person who would deal with the holder of the heirship certificate or with the holder of the LOA3. once the heirship certificate is granted, you can submit that alongwith the registered release deed to the society for mutating the share certificate to enter the name of the mother in the society's records4. the above steps will complete the title of your mother to the propertyYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "If there is a clear description of all the assets both movable and immovable left behind by her duly bequeathed them in her Will, then the probate of Will would be more than sufficient for claiming all her dues available with any entity.If there is no specific mention about all the assets or if some of them have been missed out in the Will then she may have to file a suit for declaration to declare her as the surviving legal heir to succeed to all the estates of the deceased person in the capacity of biological mother to the deceased daughter.Since your mother is not falling under the list of class I lgal heirs, the Tehsildar cannot issue a legal heirship certificate to your mother because of this.The Tahsildar is empowered to issue legal heirship certificate only in respect of class I legal heirs.The list of legal heirs as perHindu Succession Actis given below:15. General rules of succession in the case of female Hindus.—(1) The property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the rules set out in section 16,—(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband;(b) secondly, upon the heirs of the husband;(c) thirdly, upon the mother and father;(d) fourthly, upon the heirs of the father; and(e) lastly, upon the heirs of the mother.Therefore if all the properties are covered in the said Will a probate order granted by the court competent would be sufficient to acquire the assets lying everywhere."

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If there is a declaration of ownership sought and as a consequence for declaring the sale deed registered in favour of your wife as not binding on you, then the court decree would require registration to nullify the registration of the initial sale deed registered in favour of your wife. You can lodge that decree for registration immediately. However the sub-registrar may refuse to register and may ask you to wait for expiry of the appeal period3. i dont think so because there is no transfer happening or any passing of consideration to anybody4. it is still in force.

But bank will take its hands off and recovery with interest whatever is advanced to you. Best option is purchase open plot and immediately construct house on it. Grabbing a constructed house is very difficult. You can also invest in gated community where your property will be safer as there will be security provided of community. You need not come to India. Any immovable property can be sold, purchased or gifted  by person residing abroad through Special Power Attorney. The procedure is, draft a special power of attorney on Indian stamp paper of 100 rupees which  is available in all countries  or even on white paper giving SPA to any of your relatives/friend to sell the property.  Go to Indian consulate/high commissioner and get SPA attested which  the consulate official will readily do. Due to pandemic walk-ins to Consulate are suspended, you can get the SPA attested online. Send the SPA to the person named, he will take the SPA to the District Registrar who will validate it by putting his seal and signature. Fee for validation of SPA is 1 % if it is given to blood relation if given to other person it is 2% of government valuation of the property. With the validated SPA you property can be sold by person named and proceeds can be deposited in your account.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

You can lodge that decree for registration immediately.

But bank will take its hands off and recovery with interest whatever is advanced to you. Best option is purchase open plot and immediately construct house on it. Grabbing a constructed house is very difficult. You can also invest in gated community where your property will be safer as there will be security provided of community. You need not come to India. Any immovable property can be sold, purchased or gifted  by person residing abroad through Special Power Attorney. The procedure is, draft a special power of attorney on Indian stamp paper of 100 rupees which  is available in all countries  or even on white paper giving SPA to any of your relatives/friend to sell the property.  Go to Indian consulate/high commissioner and get SPA attested which  the consulate official will readily do. Due to pandemic walk-ins to Consulate are suspended, you can get the SPA attested online. Send the SPA to the person named, he will take the SPA to the District Registrar who will validate it by putting his seal and signature. Fee for validation of SPA is 1 % if it is given to blood relation if given to other person it is 2% of government valuation of the property. With the validated SPA you property can be sold by person named and proceeds can be deposited in your account.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "The question of HUF property arises only if it is a joint Hindu family which has been in common possession and enjoyment of all the coparceners for generations together and has not been partitioned. Your father's estate is not ancestral as you say he had inherited it (as his absolute and exclusive share). After your father's death, his estate devolves upon all his legal heirs equally, you and your brothers, sisters, mother and grandmother (father's mother). You cannot be legally recognised as a 'karta'.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

There will be also a clause for violation of the terms and conditions in the agreement. If any one of the parties violates, then the violating party will be liable for the penalty or remedy mentioned in the agreement. Normally, if the violating party is obeying the violation clause, there will also be a litigation clause to claim their remedy as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. The litigation may be either from the appropriate court of laws depending upon the territorial or monetary jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement or with the Arbitration clause in which the Arbitrator will be appointed as per the Arbitration act.KumaresanAdvocate, Coimbatore38 AnswersTalk to Advocate Kumaresan"

    "answer": "If there is a clear description of all the assets both movable and immovable left behind by her duly bequeathed them in her Will, then the probate of Will would be more than sufficient for claiming all her dues available with any entity.If there is no specific mention about all the assets or if some of them have been missed out in the Will then she may have to file a suit for declaration to declare her as the surviving legal heir to succeed to all the estates of the deceased person in the capacity of biological mother to the deceased daughter.Since your mother is not falling under the list of class I lgal heirs, the Tehsildar cannot issue a legal heirship certificate to your mother because of this.The Tahsildar is empowered to issue legal heirship certificate only in respect of class I legal heirs.The list of legal heirs as perHindu Succession Actis given below:15. General rules of succession in the case of female Hindus.—(1) The property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the rules set out in section 16,—(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband;(b) secondly, upon the heirs of the husband;(c) thirdly, upon the mother and father;(d) fourthly, upon the heirs of the father; and(e) lastly, upon the heirs of the mother.Therefore if all the properties are covered in the said Will a probate order granted by the court competent would be sufficient to acquire the assets lying everywhere."

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

You can lodge that decree for registration immediately. However the sub-registrar may refuse to register and may ask you to wait for expiry of the appeal period3. i dont think so because there is no transfer happening or any passing of consideration to anybody4. it is still in force.

However, a change of lawyer is not hard if the money demanded is high2) At the initiation of a lawsuit, the pleader has to file to the Court a duly signed written document by the client, which is termed as a Vakalatnama. At the very first instance after being dissatisfied with the lawyer, the client should try and resolve the issue amicably. If it is not resolved then he might ask for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the advocate on the Vakalatnama or on other documents related to the case.There may be cases when the advocate does not agree to give a NOC, then the person can issue a notice of termination to the advocate and apply to the court for withdrawal of Vakalatnama.3) Peruse the forum record and if you find it that lying with record then file an application for return of the original document.

    "answer": "Since the plaintiff delayed the exparte evidence, the defendant has appeared through his advocate and filed vakalatnama as well as an application to set aside the exparte orders passed against  him.It appears that the court has passed the exparte orders against the defendant and to pass an exparte judgment the court has directed the plaintiff to let in exparte evidence.Since the plaintiff took his own time  and delayed the matter, the defendant coming to know about the situation had entered appearance through his counsel.Now the case has been posted for filing of say/counter/reply to his application seeking to set aside the exparte orders passed against him.Since the application for setting aside the exparte orders would be allowed by court, in the meantime the court has passed an order to the plaintiff to file his counter objection to that application filed by the defendant seeking to set aside the exparte orders.You may be in touch with your advocate on all such further issues.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The divorce decree passed by Gulf court has no impact over the suits you have filed in connection with immovable properties lying in India.3. The answer given to the first point applies to this question too.4. By giving vakalatnama to her advocate, the court will permit her advocate to represent her side case, if the court is passing an order for her personal appearance then only she has to appear before court.5.

    "answer": "If the existing co purchasers have no objection against inclusion of your name as a co purchaser then I don't see any reason why the builder would have a problemThe existing co purchasers would not be selling any part of their share to youYou are just being included as a co purchaser with themFor that a supplementary agreement has to be made in which it would be stated that all the terms of the principal agreement would remain same and be binding on all the 3 co purchasers nowSo the builder will be the seller, the existing co purchasers would be the confirming parties and you would be the 3rd joint purchaserThe allotment of the new flat would happen jointly to all the 3 co purchasers under the supplementary agreementThis agreement would not attract any stamp duty since the duty is already paid on the principal agreement and there would be nominal registration feeThe builder is concerned with his money. So whether that is paid by 2 or 3 co purchasers it should hardly matter to himSo whatever contribution you would make towards the sale price to the builder, for that you can claim capital gains tax exemptionIf you go for an assignment of rights by the existing co purchasers to you by paying them certain amount then such assignment would be subject to the main agreement. The builder may ask for a transfer fee in that case.Under the Gift deed option as suggested by the builder I fail to understand how he would then bind you under the terms of the main agreement which would contain many protection clauses in favour of the builderThe gift deed will be between the existing co purchasers and yourself. So how will there be a privity of contract between you and the builder? In case of any breach of the agreement terms the builder cannot sue you as there would be no privity of contract with you. He can only sue his original co purchasers. So his suggestion of gift deed is strangeAlso since no consideration would pass under the gift deed you cannot also claim any capital gains tax exemptionYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Section 202 empowers Magistrate to postpone issue of summons to accused until be directs investigation by police or himself inquires in to the complaint as any offence  is made out or not. Magistrate  is in doubt whether any offence  is made out or not.Having once approached High Court and the High Court having declined to quash FIR, there is very bleak possibility that their petition will be entertained.They can certainly approach High Court for quash of fresh complaint underSection 406, 418 and 420 as it is an after thought.  Complaint is filed to compensate for dropping of charges.Ingredients of offence under Section 376 and 307 are distinct fromSection 498A.

    "question": "376, 307 charges dropped in chargesheet submission and to harass us new complaint filed u/s 420",
    "answer": "Section 202 Cr.p.c.  states thus:Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under section 192, may, if he thinks fit and shall in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he exercises his jurisdiction, postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding;1.  The high court already has passed the order dismissing the quash petition for the reasons shown therein, however since the complaint is once again made afresh it will be a new case to which the proposed quash is sought, but it should be pleaded on merits and not on the jurisdictional point of view because the previous judgment is very clear about the jurisdictional aspect.2. High court may not entertain any fresh quash petition on the same grounds just because the charges under other sections were dropped.In fact the plea taken over the jurisdictional point of view seeking to quash the FIR may not be entertained because the case is at the preliminary stage only, if the charge sheet is filed after investigation and you find any lacuna in the investigation or feel that the charges are false then you can file a quash petition to quash the charge sheet on the basis of the contents of the charge sheet alone and not o the jurisdictional point of view, because the investigation has been conducted by the agency and has submitted their final report, therefore the court which is taking cognizance of the offence can be an additional adverse inference over your plea of jurisdictional point.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "If there is a clear description of all the assets both movable and immovable left behind by her duly bequeathed them in her Will, then the probate of Will would be more than sufficient for claiming all her dues available with any entity.If there is no specific mention about all the assets or if some of them have been missed out in the Will then she may have to file a suit for declaration to declare her as the surviving legal heir to succeed to all the estates of the deceased person in the capacity of biological mother to the deceased daughter.Since your mother is not falling under the list of class I lgal heirs, the Tehsildar cannot issue a legal heirship certificate to your mother because of this.The Tahsildar is empowered to issue legal heirship certificate only in respect of class I legal heirs.The list of legal heirs as perHindu Succession Actis given below:15. General rules of succession in the case of female Hindus.—(1) The property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the rules set out in section 16,—(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband;(b) secondly, upon the heirs of the husband;(c) thirdly, upon the mother and father;(d) fourthly, upon the heirs of the father; and(e) lastly, upon the heirs of the mother.Therefore if all the properties are covered in the said Will a probate order granted by the court competent would be sufficient to acquire the assets lying everywhere."

You can lodge that decree for registration immediately.

If it is not resolved then he might ask for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the advocate on the Vakalatnama or on other documents related to the case.There may be cases when the advocate does not agree to give a NOC, then the person can issue a notice of termination to the advocate and apply to the court for withdrawal of Vakalatnama.3) Peruse the forum record and if you find it that lying with record then file an application for return of the original document.

The procedure is, draft a special power of attorney on Indian stamp paper of 100 rupees which  is available in all countries  or even on white paper giving SPA to any of your relatives/friend to sell the property.  Go to Indian consulate/high commissioner and get SPA attested which  the consulate official will readily do. Due to pandemic walk-ins to Consulate are suspended, you can get the SPA attested online. Send the SPA to the person named, he will take the SPA to the District Registrar who will validate it by putting his seal and signature. Fee for validation of SPA is 1 % if it is given to blood relation if given to other person it is 2% of government valuation of the property.
