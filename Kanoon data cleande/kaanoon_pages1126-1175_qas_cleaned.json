    "answer": "Dear Client,Develop a strong defense strategy based on legal grounds, such as challenging the validity of the interim injunction, proving that the construction was unauthorized, and highlighting any procedural irregularities or bias in the legal process. If you believe that there has been judicial misconduct or bias due to the involvement of the principal district court judge's family, you may consider lodging a complaint with the High Court. Consult with your advocate to prepare a detailed complaint outlining the alleged misconduct and providing supporting evidence. Your advocate should explore options for seeking emergency relief, such as filing for a stay order or injunction to halt further construction pending the resolution of the dispute. Exercise caution in all interactions and communications, avoiding any actions that could be perceived as confrontational or aggressive.

People rely on hearsay advises. High court is not trial court and high court donot entertain complaint cases as other trial court do.

    "answer": "Dear client,In your legal situation, it is necessary to deal with the procedural irregularities on the wrong entry of defendants and the unclear addresses that has hindered proper delivery of summons. These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

RERA has the authority to enforce its orders, and they can take action against the builder for non-compliance, which may include penalties or other measures. You can also consider filing a case in the consumer court to increase pressure on the builder. Since you're from Indore and the flat is in Jaipur, you may prefer to file the case in Indore. Even though the initial agreement mentioned Jaipur as the jurisdiction, since there is no jurisdiction mentioned in the registry, you might have more flexibility in choosing the jurisdiction. Make sure to keep all communication with the builder, including emails, letters, and any agreements or court orders.

    "answer": "Dear Client,When drafting a contract for this loan arrangement, it's important to be clear and precise to avoid any misunderstandings later on. Here's a basic outline of the contractual conditions you can include:Clearly state the loan amount (5 lakh rupees) and the repayment terms (within 15 months).Specify whether there will be any interest charged on the loan. If there is, clearly outline the interest rate and how it will be calculated. If there is no interest charged mention it.Provide a repayment schedule detailing when and how the borrower will make payments. This could include monthly, quarterly, or lump-sum payments.Define penalties or consequences for late or missed payments. This could include additional interest, forfeiture of collateral, or any other agreed-upon penalties.If the loan is secured by any assets or collateral, describe them in detail.Specify that the borrower will have full autonomy over the institute's operations, including financial management, hiring, and curriculum.Ensure that the borrower agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to operating an educational institute.Outline the consequences if the borrower defaults on the loan, including any legal actions you may take to recover the outstanding amount.Include a clause outlining how any disputes will be resolved, whether through arbitration, mediation, or legal action.Specify the governing law of the contract, which would likely be Indian law in this case.Additionally, you may have to consider having the contract translated into Bengali by a qualified translator to ensure clarity and understanding by both parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I am giving interest free loan to a person for establishing an institute in my locality",
    "answer": "Here are the options considering you want your principal amount back in full within 15 months, without any interest or profit:Options with Repayment Guarantee:Direct Loan with Promissory Note:This is a simpler option. You provide a loan of 5 lakh rupees to the Imam. However, unlike a traditional loan, you won't charge interest. A promissory note is a legal document signed by the Imam acknowledging the debt and promising repayment within a specific timeframe (15 months in this case). This document can be helpful if there's a need to enforce repayment through legal means, though it's best to avoid this scenario.Security Deposit:This option involves framing the 5 lakh rupees as a security deposit for the institute's proper establishment and adherence to your initial vision. A legal agreement would outline the terms of the deposit, including its purpose (starting the institute) and the repayment timeframe (15 months). Upon successful establishment and operation for 15 months, the 5 lakh rupees would be returned to you.Important Considerations:Legal Agreements:For both options above,, draft a watertight agreement that protects your interests and ensures the Imam understands the repayment obligations.Guarantor:Consider having a guarantor (another trusted person) co-sign the agreement. This provides an additional layer of security in case the Imam is unable to repay.Alternative Option with Risk Mitigation:Staggered Grant:Instead of a lump sum, consider providing the funds in stages. An initial amount can be provided to kickstart the institute. Subsequent tranches can be released based on achieving pre-defined milestones (e.g., enrollment targets, completion of specific facilities). This approach offers some control over how the funds are used and reduces the risk of losing the entire amount upfront.Remember:While these options offer some safeguards, lending money always carries inherent risk. Carefully evaluate the Imam's credibility and his ability to repay within the timeframe.By discussing these options with the Imam , you can choose the approach that best balances your desire to support the institute with protecting your principal amount.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

You can also specify that the loan will be disbursed in stages.Within the contract, include a section detailing the disbursement schedule. This should outline the specific amounts to be disbursed at each stage, as well as any conditions that need to be met before each disbursement.For each payment made by the borrower, you can create a section in the contract where both parties acknowledge the payment. This could include the date of payment, the amount paid, and any relevant reference numbers (e.g., check number, bank transfer reference). Both parties should sign and date each entry to acknowledge the payment.It's also a good idea to provide the borrower with a receipt for each payment they make. This can be a separate document or part of the contract itself. The receipt should include the same information as the payment record section of the contract.You can keep track of these records digitally or in physical form, depending on your preference. If using digital records, consider storing them securely online or on a password-protected device. If using physical records, keep them in a safe place where they won't be lost or damaged.By including these elements in the contract, you'll have a clear record of each stage of the loan disbursement and repayment process.

    "question": "Purchasing new apartment from builder",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The documents you mentioned, such as the Occupancy Certificate (OC), new building permit, environmental clearance, and the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) for the land, are all crucial in ensuring the legitimacy of the property. Regarding your question about the EC for the specific apartment, it's common for such documents to not be available until the apartments are individually registered. In the absence of an apartment-specific EC, a document on the builder's letterhead confirming that the apartment has not been sold to anyone else and that you are the first buyer can indeed serve as additional proof of ownership. However, it's essential to ensure that the letter from the builder includes all relevant details, such as the apartment number, building name, survey number, and any other identifying information. This letter should also be duly signed and stamped by the builder for authenticity. Overall, while the absence of an apartment-specific EC might seem like a gap, the builder's letter can serve as a valid interim solution until such documentation becomes available.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchasing new apartment from builder",
    "answer": "While a letter from the builder stating you're the first buyer is a positive sign, it's not sufficient for an Encumbrance Certificate (EC) for the specific apartment. Here's why:An EC typically reflects encumbrances on the land itself, not individual units within a new building. Since the building is under construction, a traditional EC for the apartment might not be available yet.However, there are alternative ways to confirm the property's status:Builder Agreement:Meticulously review the agreement you have with the builder. It should clearly mention the specific apartment you're buying and confirm its free from any encumbrances.Sale Deed with Undertaking:A registered sale deed with an undertaking from the builder can serve as proof of your purchase and guarantee the apartment is free from claims. This undertaking should state that the builder will be responsible for any existing or future encumbrances on the property.You can also apply for Loan from a bank and pay the due diligence fees and you may not opt for taking loan afterwards. The benefit of this will be, that the bank will check everything for you.Here are some additional points to consider:Verify Builder Reputation:Research the builder's reputation in Vizag. Look for online reviews and check with local authorities for any complaints against them.Don't Rely Solely on Verbal Assurances:While a letter from the builder is a good starting point, don't rely solely on their verbal assurances. Get everything documented properly in the sale agreement and undertaking.By taking these steps, you can be more confident that you're buying a property with a clear title and minimizing the risk of future disputes.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourt."

    "question": "Seeking legal advice regarding franchisee issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Start by thoroughly reviewing the franchise agreement you signed with the company. Pay close attention to any clauses related to support, training, and obligations of both parties. Understanding your contractual rights and obligations will help you assess the situation better. Keep detailed records of all communications with the company, including emails, letters, and phone calls. Document any promises made, lack of support provided, and financial losses incurred as a result of the company's actions or inactions. This documentation will be crucial if you need to take legal action or negotiate a resolution. Despite the company's previous lack of assistance, continue to communicate with them in writing about your concerns and the issues you've encountered. Clearly outline the problems you've faced and the losses you've incurred. Request their cooperation in resolving the issues and recovering your losses. Many franchise agreements include clauses requiring disputes to be resolved through mediation or arbitration rather than litigation. If your agreement has such a clause, consider initiating mediation or arbitration proceedings to resolve the issues with the company in a more cost-effective and efficient manner.  If the company has materially breached the franchise agreement or failed to provide the support and services promised, you may have grounds for termination or renegotiation of the agreement. Given your current financial strain, consider seeking assistance from financial advisors or debt counselors who can help you manage your debts, renegotiate loan terms, or explore options for debt relief.  If the situation proves untenable and the company is unwilling to cooperate in resolving the issues, you may need to consider exiting the franchise agreement altogether.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Seeking legal advice regarding franchisee issue",
    "answer": "I understand you're in a difficult situation with your franchise agreement. Here's some guidance to help you navigate this:Potential Legal Avenues:Breach of Contract:The franchise agreement likely outlined the franchisor's responsibilities regarding support, training, and disclosures. Their failure to provide proper information on RTO TC and inadequate training could be considered a breach of contract.Misrepresentation:If the company misrepresented the ease of obtaining TC or the quality of vehicles, it could be misrepresentation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:This act protects franchisees from unfair trade practices. The company's lack of support and the failed rental program might fall under this act.Recommended Course of Action:Review the Franchise Agreement:Carefully examine the agreement to understand the specific rights and obligations of both parties. Look for clauses related to training, support, disclosures, and dispute resolution.Gather Evidence:Collect documents like the agreement, communication records (emails, calls), receipts, and any proof of promised but undelivered services (training materials).Consult a Franchise Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in franchise law can analyze your situation, assess the strength of your case under the mentioned legal avenues, and advise on the best course of action.Consider Mediation:Before initiating legal proceedings, explore mediation with the franchisor. A mediator can facilitate a discussion to reach an amicable settlement and avoid the cost and time of a lawsuit.Recovery of Losses:Damages:You might be able to seek compensation for financial losses caused by the franchisor's breach of contract or misrepresentation.Contract Termination:Depending on the severity of breaches, you could potentially terminate the franchise agreement and seek reimbursement of your investment.Additional Tips:Maintain Records:Keep detailed records of all future communication and expenses related to this issue.Document Efforts:Maintain a log of attempts to contact the franchisor for assistance.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourt"

These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely.

You can also consider filing a case in the consumer court to increase pressure on the builder. Since you're from Indore and the flat is in Jaipur, you may prefer to file the case in Indore. Even though the initial agreement mentioned Jaipur as the jurisdiction, since there is no jurisdiction mentioned in the registry, you might have more flexibility in choosing the jurisdiction.

    "question": "Seeking legal advice regarding franchisee issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Start by thoroughly reviewing the franchise agreement you signed with the company. Pay close attention to any clauses related to support, training, and obligations of both parties. Understanding your contractual rights and obligations will help you assess the situation better. Keep detailed records of all communications with the company, including emails, letters, and phone calls. Document any promises made, lack of support provided, and financial losses incurred as a result of the company's actions or inactions. This documentation will be crucial if you need to take legal action or negotiate a resolution. Despite the company's previous lack of assistance, continue to communicate with them in writing about your concerns and the issues you've encountered. Clearly outline the problems you've faced and the losses you've incurred. Request their cooperation in resolving the issues and recovering your losses. Many franchise agreements include clauses requiring disputes to be resolved through mediation or arbitration rather than litigation. If your agreement has such a clause, consider initiating mediation or arbitration proceedings to resolve the issues with the company in a more cost-effective and efficient manner.  If the company has materially breached the franchise agreement or failed to provide the support and services promised, you may have grounds for termination or renegotiation of the agreement. Given your current financial strain, consider seeking assistance from financial advisors or debt counselors who can help you manage your debts, renegotiate loan terms, or explore options for debt relief.  If the situation proves untenable and the company is unwilling to cooperate in resolving the issues, you may need to consider exiting the franchise agreement altogether.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Seeking legal advice regarding franchisee issue",
    "answer": "I understand you're in a difficult situation with your franchise agreement. Here's some guidance to help you navigate this:Potential Legal Avenues:Breach of Contract:The franchise agreement likely outlined the franchisor's responsibilities regarding support, training, and disclosures. Their failure to provide proper information on RTO TC and inadequate training could be considered a breach of contract.Misrepresentation:If the company misrepresented the ease of obtaining TC or the quality of vehicles, it could be misrepresentation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:This act protects franchisees from unfair trade practices. The company's lack of support and the failed rental program might fall under this act.Recommended Course of Action:Review the Franchise Agreement:Carefully examine the agreement to understand the specific rights and obligations of both parties. Look for clauses related to training, support, disclosures, and dispute resolution.Gather Evidence:Collect documents like the agreement, communication records (emails, calls), receipts, and any proof of promised but undelivered services (training materials).Consult a Franchise Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in franchise law can analyze your situation, assess the strength of your case under the mentioned legal avenues, and advise on the best course of action.Consider Mediation:Before initiating legal proceedings, explore mediation with the franchisor. A mediator can facilitate a discussion to reach an amicable settlement and avoid the cost and time of a lawsuit.Recovery of Losses:Damages:You might be able to seek compensation for financial losses caused by the franchisor's breach of contract or misrepresentation.Contract Termination:Depending on the severity of breaches, you could potentially terminate the franchise agreement and seek reimbursement of your investment.Additional Tips:Maintain Records:Keep detailed records of all future communication and expenses related to this issue.Document Efforts:Maintain a log of attempts to contact the franchisor for assistance.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourt"

    "question": "My niece admission in nursery school",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Both parents typically have equal rights when it comes to making decisions about their child's education, unless otherwise specified by a court order. If your sister and her husband have not gone through a legal separation or divorce process, the husband may still have legal rights regarding the child's education. Schools often require documentation such as a birth certificate and sometimes proof of guardianship or custody. If your sister is the legal guardian of her daughter or has sole custody, she should be able to provide documentation to support this. While it's ideal to involve both parents in a child's education, if the father is not taking responsibility and your sister has legal custody or guardianship, she may be able to enroll her daughter in school without his involvement. However, this could potentially lead to legal complications if the father disagrees or challenges the decision. Whether or not to include the father's name on the admission form depends on the school's requirements and the legal situation. If the father's name is required, your sister may need to provide it, even if he is not involved in the child's life or education.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Repercussions of investment in crypto through banned exchanges using VPN",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Using VPN to bypass restrictions may violate Indian laws and regulations related to crypto currency trading. The Indian government has taken a cautious approach towards crypto currencies and has imposed restrictions on trading and using them. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued warnings against dealing with crypto currencies through unauthorized channels, and there may be legal consequences for violating these warnings. Funds held in accounts on these exchanges may be at risk. If the government cracks down on these exchanges or if they face regulatory issues, there is a possibility of losing access to your funds. Since these exchanges operate outside of India's regulatory framework, there may be fewer protections for investors, and disputes or issues with transactions may be more challenging to resolve. If caught, you may face penalties, fines, or other punitive actions from regulatory authorities. The exact punishment can vary depending on the severity of the violation and may include fines, seizure of assets, or legal action. It's essential to understand that while using a VPN might help you bypass restrictions temporarily, it does not guarantee anonymity or protection from legal consequences. Additionally, the crypto currency landscape is constantly evolving, and regulations may change, potentially increasing the risks associated with trading on banned platforms.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In your legal situation, it is necessary to deal with the procedural irregularities on the wrong entry of defendants and the unclear addresses that has hindered proper delivery of summons. These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can also consider filing a case in the consumer court to increase pressure on the builder. Since you're from Indore and the flat is in Jaipur, you may prefer to file the case in Indore. Even though the initial agreement mentioned Jaipur as the jurisdiction, since there is no jurisdiction mentioned in the registry, you might have more flexibility in choosing the jurisdiction. Make sure to keep all communication with the builder, including emails, letters, and any agreements or court orders.

    "question": "Succession of property of woman in islamic law",
    "answer": "Under Muslim laws, non-testamentary succession is governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1973,Under Islamic laws, male and female heirs alike have the right to inherit property. Near female heirs or cognates are recognised in the class of heirs.  However, the females get only half of the quantum shares allotted to their male counterpartsThe heirs of a deceased Muslim fall under the following classes –SharersResiduariesDistant kindred relationsClass – I heirsThe sharers fall under class I heirs, and there are 12 relatives of the deceased on the  list of sharers.Wife (Widow) – takes 1/8 (one-eighth) part of share if she has children and ¼ in case of her being childless. She can never be excluded.Husband (widower) – gets 1/8 (one-eighth) shares, but in case he is childless, the share portion increases to 1/2 (one-half). He can never be excluded.Daughter –  a single daughter gets 1/2 (one-half) shares. If there are two or more then they take 2/3 (two-thirds) of shares together. In the presence of a son, she becomes a residuary. She can never be excluded.Son’s daughter – gets 1/2 (one-half) shares and if two are more then, 2/3 (two-thirds) shares. Share is reduced to 1/4 (one-fourth) when there is only one daughter and to 1/8 (one-eight) in presence of one higher son’s daughter. In the equal presence of a son’s son, she becomes a residuary. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Full sister – a full sister gets 1/2 (one-half) shares and in case there are two or more in number they together take 2/3 (two-thirds) shares. In the presence of a full brother, she becomes a residuary. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Consanguine sister – gets 1/2 (one-half) shares and 2/3 (two-thirds) together if there are two or more. In presence of a full brother, share gets reduced to 1/6 (one-sixth) and in presence of a consanguine brother, she becomes a residuary. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Uterine sister – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares if single and 1/3 (one-third) together if two are more in number. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Uterine brother – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares if single and 1/3 (one-third) together if two are more in number. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Mother – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares and never excluded. Share increases to 1/3 (one-third)  if there is no child or no son’s child or if she has a sibling. If the husband or wife of the deceased exists, then she gets 1/3 (one-third) of shares after deducting the shares of the husband or wife.Father – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares and is never excluded. When there is no child or son’s child then he becomes a residuary.But there is a certain exception to the rights of husband and wife – the estate of the deceased devolves to the blood relations equally, and the females are allowed only half of the share of the males in each class. Therefore, there is no hierarchy with respect to who inherits the estate first between the descendants, ascendents, and collaterals, as they all inherit side by side.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Succession of property of woman in islamic law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Islamic law, inheritance distribution is governed by the rules outlined in the Quran and Hadith. Here's how it typically works in the scenarios you've described:Inheritance Distribution of a Woman who has passed away intestate:If a woman dies intestate (without leaving a will), her estate will be distributed according to the rules of Sharia. In the absence of a husband, sons, or father, her daughters are entitled to a share of her estate. The daughters collectively inherit a fixed portion, usually two-thirds of the deceased woman's estate if she has children. However, this share may vary depending on specific circumstances and local interpretations of Islamic law. As for the brother, he is entitled to a share of the estate if there are no other male heirs (sons, father, husband). The brother's share would generally be half of what each daughter inherits. However, if there are other male heirs, such as sons, the brother's share may be reduced or eliminated entirely.Effect of Brother's Execution of Sale on Inheritance:If the brother has already executed the sale of a property with the entire share going to the daughters, it establishes a precedent for his acknowledgment and relinquishment of his right to inherit from that specific property. However, this action does not necessarily extend to other properties owned by the deceased woman. The brother may still have a claim to inheritance from other properties unless he explicitly waives his right or there are other legal considerations that prevent him from claiming a share.Regarding inheritance in the case of a divorced woman, the general principles of inheritance apply similarly. However, the specifics may vary depending on whether the woman has children, parents, siblings, or other relatives who are eligible heirs according to Islamic law. Inheritance laws can be complex and may vary based on cultural, regional, and legal interpretations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Seeking legal advice regarding franchisee issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Start by thoroughly reviewing the franchise agreement you signed with the company. Pay close attention to any clauses related to support, training, and obligations of both parties. Understanding your contractual rights and obligations will help you assess the situation better. Keep detailed records of all communications with the company, including emails, letters, and phone calls. Document any promises made, lack of support provided, and financial losses incurred as a result of the company's actions or inactions. This documentation will be crucial if you need to take legal action or negotiate a resolution. Despite the company's previous lack of assistance, continue to communicate with them in writing about your concerns and the issues you've encountered. Clearly outline the problems you've faced and the losses you've incurred. Request their cooperation in resolving the issues and recovering your losses. Many franchise agreements include clauses requiring disputes to be resolved through mediation or arbitration rather than litigation. If your agreement has such a clause, consider initiating mediation or arbitration proceedings to resolve the issues with the company in a more cost-effective and efficient manner.  If the company has materially breached the franchise agreement or failed to provide the support and services promised, you may have grounds for termination or renegotiation of the agreement. Given your current financial strain, consider seeking assistance from financial advisors or debt counselors who can help you manage your debts, renegotiate loan terms, or explore options for debt relief.  If the situation proves untenable and the company is unwilling to cooperate in resolving the issues, you may need to consider exiting the franchise agreement altogether.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're in a difficult situation with your franchise agreement. Here's some guidance to help you navigate this:Potential Legal Avenues:Breach of Contract:The franchise agreement likely outlined the franchisor's responsibilities regarding support, training, and disclosures. Their failure to provide proper information on RTO TC and inadequate training could be considered a breach of contract.Misrepresentation:If the company misrepresented the ease of obtaining TC or the quality of vehicles, it could be misrepresentation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:This act protects franchisees from unfair trade practices. The company's lack of support and the failed rental program might fall under this act.Recommended Course of Action:Review the Franchise Agreement:Carefully examine the agreement to understand the specific rights and obligations of both parties. Look for clauses related to training, support, disclosures, and dispute resolution.Gather Evidence:Collect documents like the agreement, communication records (emails, calls), receipts, and any proof of promised but undelivered services (training materials).Consult a Franchise Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in franchise law can analyze your situation, assess the strength of your case under the mentioned legal avenues, and advise on the best course of action.Consider Mediation:Before initiating legal proceedings, explore mediation with the franchisor. A mediator can facilitate a discussion to reach an amicable settlement and avoid the cost and time of a lawsuit.Recovery of Losses:Damages:You might be able to seek compensation for financial losses caused by the franchisor's breach of contract or misrepresentation.Contract Termination:Depending on the severity of breaches, you could potentially terminate the franchise agreement and seek reimbursement of your investment.Additional Tips:Maintain Records:Keep detailed records of all future communication and expenses related to this issue.Document Efforts:Maintain a log of attempts to contact the franchisor for assistance.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourt"

    "question": "Succession of property of woman in islamic law",
    "answer": "Under Muslim laws, non-testamentary succession is governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1973,Under Islamic laws, male and female heirs alike have the right to inherit property. Near female heirs or cognates are recognised in the class of heirs.  However, the females get only half of the quantum shares allotted to their male counterpartsThe heirs of a deceased Muslim fall under the following classes –SharersResiduariesDistant kindred relationsClass – I heirsThe sharers fall under class I heirs, and there are 12 relatives of the deceased on the  list of sharers.Wife (Widow) – takes 1/8 (one-eighth) part of share if she has children and ¼ in case of her being childless. She can never be excluded.Husband (widower) – gets 1/8 (one-eighth) shares, but in case he is childless, the share portion increases to 1/2 (one-half). He can never be excluded.Daughter –  a single daughter gets 1/2 (one-half) shares. If there are two or more then they take 2/3 (two-thirds) of shares together. In the presence of a son, she becomes a residuary. She can never be excluded.Son’s daughter – gets 1/2 (one-half) shares and if two are more then, 2/3 (two-thirds) shares. Share is reduced to 1/4 (one-fourth) when there is only one daughter and to 1/8 (one-eight) in presence of one higher son’s daughter. In the equal presence of a son’s son, she becomes a residuary. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Full sister – a full sister gets 1/2 (one-half) shares and in case there are two or more in number they together take 2/3 (two-thirds) shares. In the presence of a full brother, she becomes a residuary. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Consanguine sister – gets 1/2 (one-half) shares and 2/3 (two-thirds) together if there are two or more. In presence of a full brother, share gets reduced to 1/6 (one-sixth) and in presence of a consanguine brother, she becomes a residuary. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Uterine sister – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares if single and 1/3 (one-third) together if two are more in number. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Uterine brother – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares if single and 1/3 (one-third) together if two are more in number. Can be excluded under certain conditions.Mother – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares and never excluded. Share increases to 1/3 (one-third)  if there is no child or no son’s child or if she has a sibling. If the husband or wife of the deceased exists, then she gets 1/3 (one-third) of shares after deducting the shares of the husband or wife.Father – gets 1/6 (one-sixth) shares and is never excluded. When there is no child or son’s child then he becomes a residuary.But there is a certain exception to the rights of husband and wife – the estate of the deceased devolves to the blood relations equally, and the females are allowed only half of the share of the males in each class. Therefore, there is no hierarchy with respect to who inherits the estate first between the descendants, ascendents, and collaterals, as they all inherit side by side.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Succession of property of woman in islamic law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Islamic law, inheritance distribution is governed by the rules outlined in the Quran and Hadith. Here's how it typically works in the scenarios you've described:Inheritance Distribution of a Woman who has passed away intestate:If a woman dies intestate (without leaving a will), her estate will be distributed according to the rules of Sharia. In the absence of a husband, sons, or father, her daughters are entitled to a share of her estate. The daughters collectively inherit a fixed portion, usually two-thirds of the deceased woman's estate if she has children. However, this share may vary depending on specific circumstances and local interpretations of Islamic law. As for the brother, he is entitled to a share of the estate if there are no other male heirs (sons, father, husband). The brother's share would generally be half of what each daughter inherits. However, if there are other male heirs, such as sons, the brother's share may be reduced or eliminated entirely.Effect of Brother's Execution of Sale on Inheritance:If the brother has already executed the sale of a property with the entire share going to the daughters, it establishes a precedent for his acknowledgment and relinquishment of his right to inherit from that specific property. However, this action does not necessarily extend to other properties owned by the deceased woman. The brother may still have a claim to inheritance from other properties unless he explicitly waives his right or there are other legal considerations that prevent him from claiming a share.Regarding inheritance in the case of a divorced woman, the general principles of inheritance apply similarly. However, the specifics may vary depending on whether the woman has children, parents, siblings, or other relatives who are eligible heirs according to Islamic law. Inheritance laws can be complex and may vary based on cultural, regional, and legal interpretations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My niece admission in nursery school",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Both parents typically have equal rights when it comes to making decisions about their child's education, unless otherwise specified by a court order. If your sister and her husband have not gone through a legal separation or divorce process, the husband may still have legal rights regarding the child's education. Schools often require documentation such as a birth certificate and sometimes proof of guardianship or custody. If your sister is the legal guardian of her daughter or has sole custody, she should be able to provide documentation to support this. While it's ideal to involve both parents in a child's education, if the father is not taking responsibility and your sister has legal custody or guardianship, she may be able to enroll her daughter in school without his involvement. However, this could potentially lead to legal complications if the father disagrees or challenges the decision. Whether or not to include the father's name on the admission form depends on the school's requirements and the legal situation. If the father's name is required, your sister may need to provide it, even if he is not involved in the child's life or education.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My niece admission in nursery school",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Both parents typically have equal rights when it comes to making decisions about their child's education, unless otherwise specified by a court order. If your sister and her husband have not gone through a legal separation or divorce process, the husband may still have legal rights regarding the child's education. Schools often require documentation such as a birth certificate and sometimes proof of guardianship or custody. If your sister is the legal guardian of her daughter or has sole custody, she should be able to provide documentation to support this. While it's ideal to involve both parents in a child's education, if the father is not taking responsibility and your sister has legal custody or guardianship, she may be able to enroll her daughter in school without his involvement. However, this could potentially lead to legal complications if the father disagrees or challenges the decision. Whether or not to include the father's name on the admission form depends on the school's requirements and the legal situation. If the father's name is required, your sister may need to provide it, even if he is not involved in the child's life or education.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Supreme Court judgements have allowed single parents or mothers with custody to make such decisions.Use your sister's name and details on the admission form.

Explain the situation to the school administration if they insist on both parents' photos.Confirm the specific requirements for your state or region regarding school enrollment for children in such situations.Keep a copy of the birth certificate and any communication with the school regarding enrollment for your records.If the school insists on involving the father, be prepared to explain the situation.

In the above-mentioned three circumstances, the marriage can be held null and void. Additionally, if the marriage has not been consummated due to impotence of the respondent, the marriage can be considered null and void. Also, the marriage can be considered null and void if that the consent of the guardian was obtained by force or by fraud; or the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.If she is reported to be suffering from borderline mental disorder which do not incapacitate her for this marriage then you may not be able to get the marriage nullified by annulment of marriage.For a decree of nullity, it is essential to prove that the ailment rendered the respondent incapable of marriage and the procreation of children.Whereas in your case she was very well capable of marriage hence you have no chance to file an annulment petition on this ground.However as per to the Section 13 of the Act, divorce or judicial separation can be obtained if the person has been “incurably of unsound mind,” or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from “mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.As your marriage is not  completed one year yet, you can file a petition under section 10 of the HMA for judicial separation which can subsequently be converted to divorce after one year, so that you can get the relief of living separately away from her without being subjected to the acts of cruelty from her side.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If both you and your spouse are willing to cooperate and reach agreements on key issues such as property division, child custody, and spousal support, an amicable divorce can generally proceed more smoothly and quickly. Annulment essentially declares the marriage null and void, as if it never existed. Grounds for annulment typically include fraud, duress, or incapacity to consent to the marriage, such as mental illness. Mental cruelty could potentially be grounds for annulment; Annulment might be faster than divorce. If you decide to pursue divorce on grounds of mental cruelty, you'll need to gather evidence to support your claim. This evidence might include documentation of abusive behavior, testimonies from witnesses, and any relevant communication such as the WhatsApp messages you mentioned.

In the above-mentioned three circumstances, the marriage can be held null and void. Additionally, if the marriage has not been consummated due to impotence of the respondent, the marriage can be considered null and void. Also, the marriage can be considered null and void if that the consent of the guardian was obtained by force or by fraud; or the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.If she is reported to be suffering from borderline mental disorder which do not incapacitate her for this marriage then you may not be able to get the marriage nullified by annulment of marriage.For a decree of nullity, it is essential to prove that the ailment rendered the respondent incapable of marriage and the procreation of children.Whereas in your case she was very well capable of marriage hence you have no chance to file an annulment petition on this ground.However as per to the Section 13 of the Act, divorce or judicial separation can be obtained if the person has been “incurably of unsound mind,” or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from “mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.As your marriage is not  completed one year yet, you can file a petition under section 10 of the HMA for judicial separation which can subsequently be converted to divorce after one year, so that you can get the relief of living separately away from her without being subjected to the acts of cruelty from her side.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If both you and your spouse are willing to cooperate and reach agreements on key issues such as property division, child custody, and spousal support, an amicable divorce can generally proceed more smoothly and quickly. Annulment essentially declares the marriage null and void, as if it never existed. Grounds for annulment typically include fraud, duress, or incapacity to consent to the marriage, such as mental illness. Mental cruelty could potentially be grounds for annulment; Annulment might be faster than divorce. If you decide to pursue divorce on grounds of mental cruelty, you'll need to gather evidence to support your claim. This evidence might include documentation of abusive behavior, testimonies from witnesses, and any relevant communication such as the WhatsApp messages you mentioned.

You may need to provide evidence of the need for personal use. If the Pagdi tenants refuse to vacate after receiving proper notice, you may need to pursue legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a case in the Rent Control Court or similar authority. If a tenant has kept the premises closed for an extended period without valid reasons, this could potentially be used as grounds for eviction. Given the complexity of Pagdi system laws and eviction procedures, it's advisable to consult with  advocate who specializes in property and tenancy law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the above-mentioned three circumstances, the marriage can be held null and void. Additionally, if the marriage has not been consummated due to impotence of the respondent, the marriage can be considered null and void.

    "question": "Divorce / annulment time in short non-consummated marriage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The impact of the \"relative impotence\" tag in annulment cases can vary depending on cultural and societal perceptions. In many places, impotence might carry a stigma, affecting a person's self-esteem and reputation. Courts may grant annulments on grounds of impotence if it's proven to be a pre-existing condition that was undisclosed before marriage and renders the marriage unconsummated. Proving impotence typically requires medical evidence, and courts may grant annulments sparingly, especially if there's doubt about the validity of the claim.The cooling-off period is categorically included in HMA and the intention of the legislature is to provide the couple a minimum period of 6 months to reconsider their decision and if possible, to reconcile their differences.In cases ofmutual consent divorce, where both parties agree to end the marriage amicably, courts may be more inclined to accommodate requests to waive waiting periods. However, whether such requests are granted depends on the specific laws and discretion of the court. Factors such as the circumstances of the separation, any agreements reached between the parties, and the court's assessment of the situation will influence the decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can landowner evict a tenant under pagdi system?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In many cases, landlords can legally evict tenants for personal use, but this typically requires specific legal procedures, including serving eviction notices and possibly obtaining permission from a Rent Control Authority or similar body. Valid reasons for evicting tenants for personal use may include needing the space for oneself or for close family members like your brother. You may need to provide evidence of the need for personal use. If the Pagdi tenants refuse to vacate after receiving proper notice, you may need to pursue legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a case in the Rent Control Court or similar authority. If a tenant has kept the premises closed for an extended period without valid reasons, this could potentially be used as grounds for eviction. Given the complexity of Pagdi system laws and eviction procedures, it's advisable to consult with  advocate who specializes in property and tenancy law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce / annulment time in short non-consummated marriage",
    "answer": "From a psychiatric perspective, a Hindu marriage is voidable according to this law if either party:Is incapable of giving a valid consent as a consequence of unsoundness of mind orThough capable of giving a valid consent has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children, orHas been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity. In the above-mentioned three circumstances, the marriage can be held null and void. Additionally, if the marriage has not been consummated due to impotence of the respondent, the marriage can be considered null and void. Also, the marriage can be considered null and void if that the consent of the guardian was obtained by force or by fraud; or the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.If she is reported to be suffering from borderline mental disorder which do not incapacitate her for this marriage then you may not be able to get the marriage nullified by annulment of marriage.For a decree of nullity, it is essential to prove that the ailment rendered the respondent incapable of marriage and the procreation of children.Whereas in your case she was very well capable of marriage hence you have no chance to file an annulment petition on this ground.However as per to the Section 13 of the Act, divorce or judicial separation can be obtained if the person has been “incurably of unsound mind,” or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from “mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.As your marriage is not  completed one year yet, you can file a petition under section 10 of the HMA for judicial separation which can subsequently be converted to divorce after one year, so that you can get the relief of living separately away from her without being subjected to the acts of cruelty from her side.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Divorce / annulment time in short non-consummated marriage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If both you and your spouse are willing to cooperate and reach agreements on key issues such as property division, child custody, and spousal support, an amicable divorce can generally proceed more smoothly and quickly. Annulment essentially declares the marriage null and void, as if it never existed. Grounds for annulment typically include fraud, duress, or incapacity to consent to the marriage, such as mental illness. Mental cruelty could potentially be grounds for annulment; Annulment might be faster than divorce. If you decide to pursue divorce on grounds of mental cruelty, you'll need to gather evidence to support your claim. This evidence might include documentation of abusive behavior, testimonies from witnesses, and any relevant communication such as the WhatsApp messages you mentioned. However, proving mental cruelty can sometimes be challenging and may involve a lengthy legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce / annulment time in short non-consummated marriage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The impact of the \"relative impotence\" tag in annulment cases can vary depending on cultural and societal perceptions. In many places, impotence might carry a stigma, affecting a person's self-esteem and reputation. Courts may grant annulments on grounds of impotence if it's proven to be a pre-existing condition that was undisclosed before marriage and renders the marriage unconsummated. Proving impotence typically requires medical evidence, and courts may grant annulments sparingly, especially if there's doubt about the validity of the claim.The cooling-off period is categorically included in HMA and the intention of the legislature is to provide the couple a minimum period of 6 months to reconsider their decision and if possible, to reconcile their differences.In cases ofmutual consent divorce, where both parties agree to end the marriage amicably, courts may be more inclined to accommodate requests to waive waiting periods. However, whether such requests are granted depends on the specific laws and discretion of the court. Factors such as the circumstances of the separation, any agreements reached between the parties, and the court's assessment of the situation will influence the decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In many cases, landlords can legally evict tenants for personal use, but this typically requires specific legal procedures, including serving eviction notices and possibly obtaining permission from a Rent Control Authority or similar body. Valid reasons for evicting tenants for personal use may include needing the space for oneself or for close family members like your brother. You may need to provide evidence of the need for personal use. If the Pagdi tenants refuse to vacate after receiving proper notice, you may need to pursue legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a case in the Rent Control Court or similar authority. If a tenant has kept the premises closed for an extended period without valid reasons, this could potentially be used as grounds for eviction.

    "answer": "Dear Client,“A” should file the case in Telangana state since “A” is the lender from Telangana. Jurisdiction typically lies where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business. Since the transactions took place in Telangana, the case should be filed there. The jurisdiction of the court would likely be the appropriate Magistrate Court in Telangana. It is not mandatory for “A” to attend all adjournments personally. “A” can authorize a legal representative, such as advocate, to represent them in court proceedings. However, “A” should stay in touch with their advocate and remain informed about the progress of the case. If “A” is physically challenged or medically unfit to attend court proceedings, they can seek permission from the court to have a representative, such as a family member or friend, attend on their behalf. The court may grant such permission upon submission of appropriate documentation and a valid reason for the request. It is advisable for A to represent the bounced cheques to the bank for a second time, especially if there is a chance that the issues causing the bounce can be resolved. This is typically done to fulfill legal requirements and to provide evidence of attempts to recover the funds.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can landowner evict a tenant under pagdi system?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In many cases, landlords can legally evict tenants for personal use, but this typically requires specific legal procedures, including serving eviction notices and possibly obtaining permission from a Rent Control Authority or similar body. Valid reasons for evicting tenants for personal use may include needing the space for oneself or for close family members like your brother. You may need to provide evidence of the need for personal use. If the Pagdi tenants refuse to vacate after receiving proper notice, you may need to pursue legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a case in the Rent Control Court or similar authority. If a tenant has kept the premises closed for an extended period without valid reasons, this could potentially be used as grounds for eviction.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Including an estimated carpet area along with the super built area in the query may be necessary to comply with local regulations or requirements. While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area. However, it's essential to ensure that any estimates provided are accurate and clearly disclosed as approximations. It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing. If the lawyer had to include the carpet area in the query to meet regulatory standards, it might not be feasible to exclude it in the gift deed without potentially facing complications or non-compliance issues. It's possible to mention in the gift deed that your father is transferring his share of the super built area of the flat to you, especially if you jointly hold the flat with him. However, it's crucial to ensure that the language used in the deed accurately reflects the terms of the transfer and complies with legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deal cancellation by one co-owner/seller after payment of full consideration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In a specific-performance lawsuit, the fact that there are two co-owners, with only one wanting to cancel the deal, can indeed make a difference. Specific performance is a legal remedy where a court orders a party to perform according to the terms of a contract.In your case, where one co-owner wants to cancel the deal but the other wants to proceed, the court would likely consider several factors such as: Since the property in question is a single, undivided bungalow located on a lease-hold plot, it might be difficult for the court to physically divide the property between the co-owners. This could weigh in favor of granting specific performance.  The fact that the buyer has already paid full consideration to one of the co-owners, as well as significant non-refundable fees, could strengthen the argument for specific performance. The court may consider the unfairness of allowing one party to back out after the other party has already fulfilled their obligations.  The court may consider the intentions of both co-owners. If one co-owner has willingly entered into the contract and desires to proceed with the deal, this could be a factor in favor of specific performance. If specific performance is not granted, the buyer could suffer prejudice, especially considering the payments already made and the non-refundable nature of some fees. This could be a factor in favor of granting specific performance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Actual selling price vs stamp duty price of rural agriculture property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If you're receiving a cash component as part of the property transaction, it's crucial to declare this amount accurately to tax authorities. Failing to do so can lead to potential legal and tax consequences in the future. You should report this cash component as part of your income during the relevant tax year. This ensures that your income tax filings are in compliance with the law. Keep thorough documentation of the entire transaction, including any cash component received. This documentation should include the sale agreement, receipts, bank statements, and any other relevant paperwork. Having a clear paper trail can help support your case in case of any inquiries from tax authorities. Both you as the seller and the buyer need to consider the tax implications of the transaction. Sellers typically incur capital gains tax on the profit made from selling the property. If you receive a cash component, this amount would still be subject to capital gains tax. As for the buyer, they should be aware that paying a portion of the transaction in cash doesn't absolve them of their tax obligations. They should ensure that they have proper documentation for the entire transaction to avoid any legal issues. If both parties are willing, conducting the entire transaction through bank transactions can help ensure transparency and legality.

    "question": "Deal cancellation by one co-owner/seller after payment of full consideration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In a specific-performance lawsuit, the fact that there are two co-owners, with only one wanting to cancel the deal, can indeed make a difference. Specific performance is a legal remedy where a court orders a party to perform according to the terms of a contract.In your case, where one co-owner wants to cancel the deal but the other wants to proceed, the court would likely consider several factors such as: Since the property in question is a single, undivided bungalow located on a lease-hold plot, it might be difficult for the court to physically divide the property between the co-owners. This could weigh in favor of granting specific performance.  The fact that the buyer has already paid full consideration to one of the co-owners, as well as significant non-refundable fees, could strengthen the argument for specific performance. The court may consider the unfairness of allowing one party to back out after the other party has already fulfilled their obligations.  The court may consider the intentions of both co-owners. If one co-owner has willingly entered into the contract and desires to proceed with the deal, this could be a factor in favor of specific performance. If specific performance is not granted, the buyer could suffer prejudice, especially considering the payments already made and the non-refundable nature of some fees. This could be a factor in favor of granting specific performance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area. However, it's essential to ensure that any estimates provided are accurate and clearly disclosed as approximations. It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing.

It's important to understand the details of this deed and whether it addresses the violation of the non-alienation clause. The endorsement issued by the assistant commissioner in 2023 indicates that there are no pending cases on the land; it doesn't necessarily mean that the violation of the non-alienation clause has been addressed or resolved.

The best talent is drawn through the Civil Services Examination. Encouraging employees of PSUs to sit for such examination which is highly competitive is in line with the purpose behind the OM of 1989 of attracting the best talent. Even assuming that for the purposes of pay protection, the distinction between selection through interview and selection through open competitive examination does hold a rational nexus, the Civil Services Examination, through which the petitioner has been selected also comprises a comprehensive interview. Therefore denial of pay protection benefit to the petitioner is unjustified and illegal.Hence you may take a cue from the above referred judgment which may come handy to you to solve your problem.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

There are few steps you can take to determine your eligibility for pay protection and gather relevant information:Search the policies and regulations governing pay protection for employees transitioning from one government job to another. These policies may vary based on factors such as the length of service, the nature of the new position, and the rules of the respective government departments.Reach out to the Human Resources (HR) or administrative department of your new employer, in this case, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), to inquire about pay protection policies. They should be able to provide you with relevant information or direct you to the appropriate resources.Look for circulars, office memoranda, or orders issued by the government or relevant departments regarding pay protection for employees transitioning through SSC CGL or similar recruitment processes. These documents often outline eligibility criteria, procedures, and any supporting documentation required.If you're unable to find specific information regarding pay protection, consider reaching out to your HR department or contacting the SSC regional office for clarification.

This can vary based on the policies of the institution or university.Procedure for Relaxation of Rules for Recruitment in a State Government University:Identify the specific rule or rules that require relaxation.Formulate a proposal detailing the reasons for relaxation and its potential impact.Present the proposal to the appropriate authority within the university, such as the Board of Governors or the Academic Council.If the authority approves, draft an official notification detailing the relaxation of rules.Publish the notification in the university's official gazette or bulletin to inform all concerned parties.It is possible for the upper age limit to be the same for entry-level posts like Assistant Professor and higher posts like Associate Professor and Professor. However, this would depend on the policies and regulations set by the university or governing body. While it's not mandatory to publish the relaxation of rules in leading newspapers, it's good practice to ensure transparency and inform potential candidates about any changes in recruitment procedures. Amended rules can be followed on 14.9.2024 if they have been officially approved and communicated by the relevant authority, even if the posts and vacancies were made and sanctioned earlier. The key is that the amended rules must be in effect at the time of recruitment or promotion.The decision between filling vacant Professor Posts or upgrading Associate Professor posts can depend on various factors such as institutional needs, availability of qualified candidates, and budgetary considerations. Typically, institutions prioritize filling vacant posts to ensure the smooth functioning of academic departments. However, if there is a policy or scheme in place like the Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DCAP), it may provide guidelines on the order of priority for promotions versus direct recruitment. It's essential to adhere to the policies and procedures established by the university or governing body in making such decisions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deal cancellation by one co-owner/seller after payment of full consideration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In a specific-performance lawsuit, the fact that there are two co-owners, with only one wanting to cancel the deal, can indeed make a difference. Specific performance is a legal remedy where a court orders a party to perform according to the terms of a contract.In your case, where one co-owner wants to cancel the deal but the other wants to proceed, the court would likely consider several factors such as: Since the property in question is a single, undivided bungalow located on a lease-hold plot, it might be difficult for the court to physically divide the property between the co-owners. This could weigh in favor of granting specific performance.  The fact that the buyer has already paid full consideration to one of the co-owners, as well as significant non-refundable fees, could strengthen the argument for specific performance. The court may consider the unfairness of allowing one party to back out after the other party has already fulfilled their obligations.  The court may consider the intentions of both co-owners. If one co-owner has willingly entered into the contract and desires to proceed with the deal, this could be a factor in favor of specific performance. If specific performance is not granted, the buyer could suffer prejudice, especially considering the payments already made and the non-refundable nature of some fees. This could be a factor in favor of granting specific performance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It's important to understand the details of this deed and whether it addresses the violation of the non-alienation clause. The endorsement issued by the assistant commissioner in 2023 indicates that there are no pending cases on the land; it doesn't necessarily mean that the violation of the non-alienation clause has been addressed or resolved.

    "answer": "In a writ petition filed before Delhi high court among many other things, it covered the following points while allowing the writ petition\"The purpose behind grant of pay protection was to draw talent from organisations like PSUs. The best talent is drawn through the Civil Services Examination. Encouraging employees of PSUs to sit for such examination which is highly competitive is in line with the purpose behind the OM of 1989 of attracting the best talent. Even assuming that for the purposes of pay protection, the distinction between selection through interview and selection through open competitive examination does hold a rational nexus, the Civil Services Examination, through which the petitioner has been selected also comprises a comprehensive interview. Therefore denial of pay protection benefit to the petitioner is unjustified and illegal.Hence you may take a cue from the above referred judgment which may come handy to you to solve your problem.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "- As per rule, Pay protection is a way of safeguarding the pay. and conditions of service of employees whose pay is adversely affected by organizational change , it means to allow the individual to find another post at their original pay band or to adjust to the lower salary within the protection period.- Further, when a government servant applies for in the same or another department through proper channel and on selection he is asked to resign the previous post for administrative reasons the resignation is called technical resignation.- Further, Protection of pay drawn in Pay Band against the post held in the previous organization shall be admissible only to such direct recruits who had applied through proper channel for appointment to the post in this department after tendering technical resignation and were holding a post in the previous organization either with same or lower grade pay- However, this protection is applicable in central govt job for only in case of government employee or state govt employee- Since, the PNB bank employee is not considered as central govt or state govt. employee , hence this facility cannot be granted to bank employee.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,While the SSC CGL notification may not explicitly mention pay protection, it's possible that such provisions exist in broader government regulations or circulars. There are few steps you can take to determine your eligibility for pay protection and gather relevant information:Search the policies and regulations governing pay protection for employees transitioning from one government job to another. These policies may vary based on factors such as the length of service, the nature of the new position, and the rules of the respective government departments.Reach out to the Human Resources (HR) or administrative department of your new employer, in this case, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), to inquire about pay protection policies. They should be able to provide you with relevant information or direct you to the appropriate resources.Look for circulars, office memoranda, or orders issued by the government or relevant departments regarding pay protection for employees transitioning through SSC CGL or similar recruitment processes. These documents often outline eligibility criteria, procedures, and any supporting documentation required.If you're unable to find specific information regarding pay protection, consider reaching out to your HR department or contacting the SSC regional office for clarification. They may be able to provide guidance based on past cases or interpretations of existing regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,While the SSC CGL notification may not explicitly mention pay protection, it's possible that such provisions exist in broader government regulations or circulars. There are few steps you can take to determine your eligibility for pay protection and gather relevant information:Search the policies and regulations governing pay protection for employees transitioning from one government job to another. These policies may vary based on factors such as the length of service, the nature of the new position, and the rules of the respective government departments.Reach out to the Human Resources (HR) or administrative department of your new employer, in this case, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), to inquire about pay protection policies. They should be able to provide you with relevant information or direct you to the appropriate resources.Look for circulars, office memoranda, or orders issued by the government or relevant departments regarding pay protection for employees transitioning through SSC CGL or similar recruitment processes. These documents often outline eligibility criteria, procedures, and any supporting documentation required.If you're unable to find specific information regarding pay protection, consider reaching out to your HR department or contacting the SSC regional office for clarification.

    "answer": "The situation what you have discussed here is not the law of the land, this may happen in some places  and not everywhere.Assuming that an event similar to what you have described here, if you go by the advise received to receive the excess amount beyond the sale consideration amount through bank transaction itself, the amount received through bank cannot be denied hence you can show the excess amount as income from other sources, and you don't have to specify the other source  in the ITR.Firstly you make sure that the registration of the property is executed by the buyer paying the actual, sale consideration amount shown in the sale deed which may be more than the government guidelines value, if the Sub-registrar is denying to register the property to the value higher than the government guidelines value, then you can approach the District registrar with a complaint against the sub-registrar and seek his direction to the sub registrar to register the same as per the value paid by the buyer which is the prevalent market price.If you do not want to take  this trouble then you can think about the alternate option as suggested above.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Actual selling price vs stamp duty price of rural agriculture property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If you're receiving a cash component as part of the property transaction, it's crucial to declare this amount accurately to tax authorities. Failing to do so can lead to potential legal and tax consequences in the future. You should report this cash component as part of your income during the relevant tax year. This ensures that your income tax filings are in compliance with the law. Keep thorough documentation of the entire transaction, including any cash component received. This documentation should include the sale agreement, receipts, bank statements, and any other relevant paperwork. Having a clear paper trail can help support your case in case of any inquiries from tax authorities. Both you as the seller and the buyer need to consider the tax implications of the transaction. Sellers typically incur capital gains tax on the profit made from selling the property. If you receive a cash component, this amount would still be subject to capital gains tax. As for the buyer, they should be aware that paying a portion of the transaction in cash doesn't absolve them of their tax obligations. They should ensure that they have proper documentation for the entire transaction to avoid any legal issues. If both parties are willing, conducting the entire transaction through bank transactions can help ensure transparency and legality. However, this may require cooperation from all parties involved, including the registrar's office.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it's possible to approach the high court as a third party in the ongoing arbitration case. However, whether the court allows your intervention depends on various factors, including the relevance of your claims to the ongoing arbitration and the discretion of the court. You would need to file an application for intervention, detailing your interest in the case and the reasons why you should be allowed to participate.Yes, you can submit an application to the arbitrator to add yourselves as third parties to the case. Again, the decision will depend on the arbitrator's discretion and the relevance of your claims to the ongoing arbitration proceedings.For speedy justice, you can explore multiple avenues:Since your project falls under RERA jurisdiction due to the lack of completion certificate and OC, you can file a joint complaint with RERA against the builder. RERA is designed to provide quick resolution to disputes related to real estate.You can jointly approach the Consumer Forum if you believe there has been a deficiency in services provided by the builder. This could lead to compensation for the deficiency as well as mental harassment.If you believe there are larger public interest issues involved, such as fraud by the builder and negligence by the municipal corporation, you can explore the option of filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) or a writ petition in the high court. However, these avenues require substantial legal grounds and evidence of public interest.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

(supra) (in para 35, 36 & 37), that there is nothing in the Act, which prohibits the few Complainants from joining together and filing Joint Complaint. The word complaint includes plural i.e., complaints also. Thus, a Joint Complaint is maintainable and it will be treated as one-complaint. … Admittedly, in the present cases, the value of the consideration paid by all the persons who have joined as Complainants in the Joint Complaint exceeds ₹2 Crores, therefore, this Commission has pecuniary jurisdiction under Section 58(1)(a)(i) of the Act to entertain all the present Joint Complaints.

It is the condominium's name that has to be entered in the 7/12 and with it the names of the apartment owners7/12 is anyway not a title document as it is only for revenue purposesyour title document is your registered agreement to sellthe unit purchasers cannot intervene in the pending arbitration case since that is a dispute between the partners of the builder firm with which the unit purchasers should not be concernedas regards discrepancy in carpet area, a rectification deed can be registeredbut if your carpet area is greater than what was promised to you then you will have to pay additional stamp duty on that extra carpet areaif the project is not registered with RERA then that tribunal will not have the jurisdiction to try any disputes between the flat buyer and builderthe 5 people will have to file a suit for specific performance of contract ie to enforce the obligation of the builder to obtain OCYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

RERA is designed to provide quick resolution to disputes related to real estate.You can jointly approach the Consumer Forum if you believe there has been a deficiency in services provided by the builder. This could lead to compensation for the deficiency as well as mental harassment.If you believe there are larger public interest issues involved, such as fraud by the builder and negligence by the municipal corporation, you can explore the option of filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) or a writ petition in the high court.

(supra) (in para 35, 36 & 37), that there is nothing in the Act, which prohibits the few Complainants from joining together and filing Joint Complaint. The word complaint includes plural i.e., complaints also. Thus, a Joint Complaint is maintainable and it will be treated as one-complaint. … Admittedly, in the present cases, the value of the consideration paid by all the persons who have joined as Complainants in the Joint Complaint exceeds ₹2 Crores, therefore, this Commission has pecuniary jurisdiction under Section 58(1)(a)(i) of the Act to entertain all the present Joint Complaints.

    "question": "Deal cancellation by one co-owner/seller after payment of full consideration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In a specific-performance lawsuit, the fact that there are two co-owners, with only one wanting to cancel the deal, can indeed make a difference. Specific performance is a legal remedy where a court orders a party to perform according to the terms of a contract.In your case, where one co-owner wants to cancel the deal but the other wants to proceed, the court would likely consider several factors such as: Since the property in question is a single, undivided bungalow located on a lease-hold plot, it might be difficult for the court to physically divide the property between the co-owners. This could weigh in favor of granting specific performance.  The fact that the buyer has already paid full consideration to one of the co-owners, as well as significant non-refundable fees, could strengthen the argument for specific performance. The court may consider the unfairness of allowing one party to back out after the other party has already fulfilled their obligations.  The court may consider the intentions of both co-owners. If one co-owner has willingly entered into the contract and desires to proceed with the deal, this could be a factor in favor of specific performance. If specific performance is not granted, the buyer could suffer prejudice, especially considering the payments already made and the non-refundable nature of some fees. This could be a factor in favor of granting specific performance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank document",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Nomination and inheritance are two different legal concepts. When someone is nominated as a beneficiary, it means they have been chosen by the account holder to receive the funds in the event of their death. Inheritance, on the other hand, involves the legal transfer of assets according to a will or intestacy laws. Your cousin brother was nominated as the beneficiary of the accounts, and the will clearly designates him as the custodian of the assets until his nephew reaches 21 years old. This shows that your cousin brother's actions were in accordance with the wishes of your late uncle. The bank confirmed your cousin brother's authority to transfer the funds from the accounts, including the HUF account, indicates that he was acting within his rights as the nominee and coparcener. If your cousin brother recorded the approval from the bank manager regarding the fund transfer, it serves as evidence that he acted in good faith and with the bank's authorization. This can support his case against the forgery charges. While the document in question may not have been on the bank's letterhead, it's crucial to establish its authenticity. Your cousin brother should provide any evidence that supports the legitimacy of the document, such as email correspondence or witnesses who can attest to its validity.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It's possible for the time period of experience required for promotion to be more than that required for direct recruitment on the post of Professor. This can vary based on the policies of the institution or university.Procedure for Relaxation of Rules for Recruitment in a State Government University:Identify the specific rule or rules that require relaxation.Formulate a proposal detailing the reasons for relaxation and its potential impact.Present the proposal to the appropriate authority within the university, such as the Board of Governors or the Academic Council.If the authority approves, draft an official notification detailing the relaxation of rules.Publish the notification in the university's official gazette or bulletin to inform all concerned parties.It is possible for the upper age limit to be the same for entry-level posts like Assistant Professor and higher posts like Associate Professor and Professor. However, this would depend on the policies and regulations set by the university or governing body. While it's not mandatory to publish the relaxation of rules in leading newspapers, it's good practice to ensure transparency and inform potential candidates about any changes in recruitment procedures. Amended rules can be followed on 14.9.2024 if they have been officially approved and communicated by the relevant authority, even if the posts and vacancies were made and sanctioned earlier. The key is that the amended rules must be in effect at the time of recruitment or promotion.The decision between filling vacant Professor Posts or upgrading Associate Professor posts can depend on various factors such as institutional needs, availability of qualified candidates, and budgetary considerations. Typically, institutions prioritize filling vacant posts to ensure the smooth functioning of academic departments. However, if there is a policy or scheme in place like the Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DCAP), it may provide guidelines on the order of priority for promotions versus direct recruitment. It's essential to adhere to the policies and procedures established by the university or governing body in making such decisions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Specific performance is a legal remedy where a court orders a party to perform a specific action, such as completing a real estate transaction. However, specific performance is typically granted when monetary damages are inadequate to compensate the aggrieved party and when the terms of the contract are clear and definite. The oral agreement in this case might complicate the matter, but if there is substantial evidence supporting the existence and terms of the agreement, specific performance could be pursued. While the NOC may not mention the buyer by name, it could still be a relevant piece of evidence supporting the existence of the agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deal cancellation by one co-owner/seller after payment of full consideration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In a specific-performance lawsuit, the fact that there are two co-owners, with only one wanting to cancel the deal, can indeed make a difference. Specific performance is a legal remedy where a court orders a party to perform according to the terms of a contract.In your case, where one co-owner wants to cancel the deal but the other wants to proceed, the court would likely consider several factors such as: Since the property in question is a single, undivided bungalow located on a lease-hold plot, it might be difficult for the court to physically divide the property between the co-owners. This could weigh in favor of granting specific performance.  The fact that the buyer has already paid full consideration to one of the co-owners, as well as significant non-refundable fees, could strengthen the argument for specific performance. The court may consider the unfairness of allowing one party to back out after the other party has already fulfilled their obligations.  The court may consider the intentions of both co-owners. If one co-owner has willingly entered into the contract and desires to proceed with the deal, this could be a factor in favor of specific performance. If specific performance is not granted, the buyer could suffer prejudice, especially considering the payments already made and the non-refundable nature of some fees. This could be a factor in favor of granting specific performance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank document",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Nomination and inheritance are two different legal concepts. When someone is nominated as a beneficiary, it means they have been chosen by the account holder to receive the funds in the event of their death. Inheritance, on the other hand, involves the legal transfer of assets according to a will or intestacy laws. Your cousin brother was nominated as the beneficiary of the accounts, and the will clearly designates him as the custodian of the assets until his nephew reaches 21 years old. This shows that your cousin brother's actions were in accordance with the wishes of your late uncle. The bank confirmed your cousin brother's authority to transfer the funds from the accounts, including the HUF account, indicates that he was acting within his rights as the nominee and coparcener. If your cousin brother recorded the approval from the bank manager regarding the fund transfer, it serves as evidence that he acted in good faith and with the bank's authorization. This can support his case against the forgery charges. While the document in question may not have been on the bank's letterhead, it's crucial to establish its authenticity. Your cousin brother should provide any evidence that supports the legitimacy of the document, such as email correspondence or witnesses who can attest to its validity.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It's possible for the time period of experience required for promotion to be more than that required for direct recruitment on the post of Professor. This can vary based on the policies of the institution or university.Procedure for Relaxation of Rules for Recruitment in a State Government University:Identify the specific rule or rules that require relaxation.Formulate a proposal detailing the reasons for relaxation and its potential impact.Present the proposal to the appropriate authority within the university, such as the Board of Governors or the Academic Council.If the authority approves, draft an official notification detailing the relaxation of rules.Publish the notification in the university's official gazette or bulletin to inform all concerned parties.It is possible for the upper age limit to be the same for entry-level posts like Assistant Professor and higher posts like Associate Professor and Professor. However, this would depend on the policies and regulations set by the university or governing body. While it's not mandatory to publish the relaxation of rules in leading newspapers, it's good practice to ensure transparency and inform potential candidates about any changes in recruitment procedures. Amended rules can be followed on 14.9.2024 if they have been officially approved and communicated by the relevant authority, even if the posts and vacancies were made and sanctioned earlier. The key is that the amended rules must be in effect at the time of recruitment or promotion.The decision between filling vacant Professor Posts or upgrading Associate Professor posts can depend on various factors such as institutional needs, availability of qualified candidates, and budgetary considerations. Typically, institutions prioritize filling vacant posts to ensure the smooth functioning of academic departments. However, if there is a policy or scheme in place like the Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DCAP), it may provide guidelines on the order of priority for promotions versus direct recruitment. It's essential to adhere to the policies and procedures established by the university or governing body in making such decisions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank document",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Nomination and inheritance are two different legal concepts. When someone is nominated as a beneficiary, it means they have been chosen by the account holder to receive the funds in the event of their death. Inheritance, on the other hand, involves the legal transfer of assets according to a will or intestacy laws. Your cousin brother was nominated as the beneficiary of the accounts, and the will clearly designates him as the custodian of the assets until his nephew reaches 21 years old. This shows that your cousin brother's actions were in accordance with the wishes of your late uncle. The bank confirmed your cousin brother's authority to transfer the funds from the accounts, including the HUF account, indicates that he was acting within his rights as the nominee and coparcener. If your cousin brother recorded the approval from the bank manager regarding the fund transfer, it serves as evidence that he acted in good faith and with the bank's authorization. This can support his case against the forgery charges. While the document in question may not have been on the bank's letterhead, it's crucial to establish its authenticity. Your cousin brother should provide any evidence that supports the legitimacy of the document, such as email correspondence or witnesses who can attest to its validity.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the land was purchased and registered in your name while you were a minor, your grandmother was appointed as your guardian. If the purchase was made using your father's funds and there's no evidence to suggest that your grandmother contributed financially, this may strengthen your ownership claim. The documentation surrounding the purchase of the land, including any agreements or contracts, will be crucial in determining the validity of your ownership. If there's clear evidence that the land was purchased with your father's funds and intended for your benefit, this may support your ownership claimAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In India, while notarization provides some level of authenticity to the document, it may not always suffice for all legal transactions, especially those involving immovable property like real estate. In many cases involving property transactions, especially those requiring documentation like a Mortgage Release Deed, it's common for parties to prefer or require a POA that is registered locally to avoid any potential legal complications or challenges. Therefore, registering a fresh POA in the Mumbai Sub Registrar office might be the safest option to ensure the validity and acceptance of the document for the intended transaction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In India, while notarization provides some level of authenticity to the document, it may not always suffice for all legal transactions, especially those involving immovable property like real estate. In many cases involving property transactions, especially those requiring documentation like a Mortgage Release Deed, it's common for parties to prefer or require a POA that is registered locally to avoid any potential legal complications or challenges. Therefore, registering a fresh POA in the Mumbai Sub Registrar office might be the safest option to ensure the validity and acceptance of the document for the intended transaction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. Registration in favor of the legal heirs of the deceased is not necessary, but if necessary you can get it mutated to all your names jointly in order to sell the property by executing a  sale deed jointly in favor of the prospective buyer.2. As the property has not been partitioned among all the legal heirs by a registered document, the mutually agreed division, if it was made by an unregistered deed, is not legally valid, besides the second floor was constructed by you without a permission or consent of your father or other legal heirs, hence if the others claim a share out of that floor also, you may have to move court to declare the title to your name based on the evidence, otherwise the sale consideration of that floor also shall have to eb divided among all the legal heirs, hence it is advisable that all the legal heirs may decide about sharing the sale consideration  amount mutually in an amicable manner..3. LTCG is different from that of the exemption claimed, if you would like to invest the LTCG in your wife's property then you can claim exemption. Relief on capital gains tax is available when LTCG is reinvested in the name of the spouse.4. Even though you constructed the second floor out of your own funds, but you do not own the land underneath, hence you cannot claim title to the property owned by your father.In the given situation if your cosharers claim a share in that property too, then you may have to amicably settle the issue instead of stretching it to legal solutions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Transfer of ownership: Since your father passed away without a will, the property would generally be inherited by all his legal heirs, which includes you and your brothers. It is advisable to get the property registered or mutated in the names of all the legal heirs before proceeding with the sale. This will establish clear ownership and avoid any future disputes.Distribution of sale proceeds: If all the brothers are owners of the property, the sale proceeds should ideally be divided equally among the legal heirs, unless there is a mutual agreement specifying a different distribution. It is recommended to have a clear written agreement among all the brothers regarding the division of proceeds to avoid any conflicts.Adding spouses' names: From a legal perspective, it is possible to add the names of the respective wives in the sale agreement. However, it is important to consult with a lawyer to understand the implications and tax considerations involved in such a transaction, including the applicability of Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax.Division of the plot: If you have constructed the second floor using a bank loan, it does not necessarily mean that the plot itself will be divided. The division of the plot would depend on the legal provisions and any specific agreements or arrangements made among the brothers. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations governing property division in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the absence of a will, the property is typically divided according to the laws of intestate succession. This could mean that the property is equally divided among the legal heirs, which would include you and your brothers. However, if there was a mutual agreement dividing the property amongst the brothers, that agreement could potentially supersede the default rules of intestate succession. If you obtained a bank loan and built the second floor with the consent or knowledge of your father and brothers, you have a stronger claim to ownership of the second floor. However, the specifics of any agreements or understandings among the family members would be crucial in determining your rights. The valuation of the property will play a significant role in determining how compensation should be divided. If the valuation distinguishes between the land and the structures (i.e., the ground floor and the second floor), then it may be reasonable to allocate compensation accordingly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Registration in favor of the legal heirs of the deceased is not necessary, but if necessary you can get it mutated to all your names jointly in order to sell the property by executing a  sale deed jointly in favor of the prospective buyer.2. As the property has not been partitioned among all the legal heirs by a registered document, the mutually agreed division, if it was made by an unregistered deed, is not legally valid, besides the second floor was constructed by you without a permission or consent of your father or other legal heirs, hence if the others claim a share out of that floor also, you may have to move court to declare the title to your name based on the evidence, otherwise the sale consideration of that floor also shall have to eb divided among all the legal heirs, hence it is advisable that all the legal heirs may decide about sharing the sale consideration  amount mutually in an amicable manner..3. LTCG is different from that of the exemption claimed, if you would like to invest the LTCG in your wife's property then you can claim exemption. Relief on capital gains tax is available when LTCG is reinvested in the name of the spouse.4. Even though you constructed the second floor out of your own funds, but you do not own the land underneath, hence you cannot claim title to the property owned by your father.In the given situation if your cosharers claim a share in that property too, then you may have to amicably settle the issue instead of stretching it to legal solutions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Owner threatening to file police complaint if flat not vacated",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Ten days might not be enough time to vacate a flat, especially considering the circumstances you've described. Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above.

    "answer": "1.  Ravi's mother is independent to take any decision regarding her 1/3rd undivided share in the property.  In other words, she can bequeath the property to anyone or to many persons by executing WILL, execute registered Gift Deed, Relinquish her share in favour of Ravi's son and/or daughter, execute settlement deed, etc.2.  In case Ravi's mother dies intestate (without executing a WILL), then her 1/3rd undivided share would be inherited equally by Ravi's son and daughter.3.  If Ravi's mother dies intestate, her other three sons would not get any share.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above.

    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

An annulment essentially declares the marriage null and void, as if it never legally existed. Grounds for annulment may include fraud, coercion, or lack of consent.

Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above.

In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Flat sale NOC, adjustment of arrear of maintenance",
    "answer": "Sinking fund charge isan amount that is kept in reserve within a housing fund's account, to be used mainly in cases of repairs and emergencies. The main objective of implementing a sinking fund charge is so that repairs can be undertaken without having to immediately worry about the costs.An outgoing member cannot ask for the reimbursement of his accumulated contribution towards the Sinking fund under any circumstance / pretext however the new buyer / member may request to know the accumulated contribution accrued against the account of the intended flat to be purchased. As and when the flat is sold or the membership is transferred this amount invariably gets automatically transferred to the buyer’s account.But in your case the builder has not formed the association neither the members had taken interest to form an association or a RWA.If the developer does not initiate the formation of RWA, residents can do so on their own. Often, developers do not allow RWAs to be formed to be able to retain control over maintenance and other charges.Ideally, formation of RWA should be initiated by the developer.Actually there is no necessity to obtain NOC from the builder in the absence of an association, for selling the property.You can issue a legal notice to the builder demanding NOC for selling the proeprty if it is required by the buyer for the purpose of home loan and also refund of the sinking fund failing which you can initiate legal action for recovery of the sinking funds either through civil court or through consumer commission or by a complaint to RERA.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property tax for a rented commercial property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When the usage of a property changes from residential to commercial, it's common for the property tax to increase. This is because commercial properties are generally taxed at a higher rate compared to residential properties. Since you're planning to rent out the property for commercial use, it's crucial to ensure that all necessary certificates, licenses, and registrations are obtained as per local regulations. This includes trade licenses, GST registration, and any other permits required for operating a commercial establishment in Kolkata. The property tax you'll have to pay going forward would depend on the specific regulations of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). KMC determines property tax based on factors like property size, type, usage, and location. Since you're converting your property into a commercial space, you'll likely be assessed at a different rate than before as follow:Developed Bustee is 8%, Government Properties  under KMC Act, 1980 is 10%, Properties having Annual value of < 30000 is 15 % and others is 20%Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This three-year period starts from the date of execution and registration of the deed.- Since , that release deed is registered from the office of the sub-registrar , hence it cannot be cancelled on any ground- Further, as 3 years period has already passed from the date of execution , then also no suit for cancellation is also maintainable for revoking the said release deed, and hence you are the single owner of the property legally.Pls. dont forget to rating .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "-As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce,- Further , as per Kerala High Court, In matrimonial issues, conduct of such type which would endanger the life of the partner amounts to cruelty. Cruelty consists of acts which are dangerous to life, limb or health. Cruelty may be physical or mental.- Your mentioned facts are showing that her behavior is causing cruelty to you  , and hence you can file a divorce petition before the family court on these grounds.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

If such situation occurs, a true owner extinguishes his ownership over the property.You have stated to have occupied the property on the basis of unregistered sale deed around 4 decades ago, hence it would be better that you get the title declared through a court of lawIn your case even if you have rented the property , you are termed to be still occupied and cannot be said that you are out of your possession.You are in continuous possession of the proeprty hence if there is any dispute regarding your title at the time of redevelopment then it is pertinent that you need to establish yor title to the property in the legally valid manner.If you are not knowing the name and address of the original vendor you can send the notice to the vendor to his last known address after which you can file a suit.This is a bit big subject hence you need to consult  and discuss in person with an experienced lawyer, and if you are really serious to solve the issue then you can take steps to solve them legally.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Here's how you can approach negotiating the price for your desired 4-BHK duplex apartment:Before Negotiation:Research: Check similar projects in the area and their pricing for 4-BHK duplexes. This will give you a benchmark for negotiation.Feasibility: Confirm with the builder if combining two 2-BHK flats into a 4-BHK duplex is structurally possible. Get this confirmation in writing. There might be limitations due to load-bearing walls etc.Negotiation Points:Bulk Purchase Discount: Highlight that you're purchasing two units, generating a larger sale for them. Request a discount for this bulk purchase.Double Charges for Amenities: Point out that you're essentially paying double for amenities like water, STP, power backup, etc., by buying two flats. Negotiate a combined rate for these considering the shared usage.Structural Changes: Negotiate for the builder to absorb some or all the cost of structural changes needed for combining the flats. This is because it saves them the cost of finishing another separate unit.Payment Terms: If possible, offer a faster payment turnaround in exchange for a better price. This incentivizes the builder to close the deal quickly.Alternative: Express willingness to walk away if negotiations aren't satisfactory. However, ensure you have explored other options and are genuinely prepared to do so.Reaching Your Budget:With your budget of 1.6-1.7 Crore, aim for a price per square foot lower than the quoted 7000/sqft for the flats.Negotiate a combined price for the two flats that falls within your budget, considering the saved amenity charges and potential discount for structural changes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Without Daughter signature father's self-acquired property sold by mother&brothers after FatherDeath",
    "answer": "Dear clientYour situation is complex and involves property law, succession rights, and interpreting a will. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some general advice (consulting a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended):Your Rights as a Daughter:Claiming Share: You likely have a right to claim your share of the 26 acres. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended in Andhra Pradesh) grants daughters equal coparcenary rights in their deceased father's self-acquired property.New Suit: You can potentially file a new suit for partition or declaration to claim your share against the current landowners. However, there might be complexities due to the time elapsed since the sale (2005) and the High Court order.Mother & Brother's Sale: The sale deed without your signature might be challenged if you weren't informed or given due share.Will and Grandchildren:Will & Grandchildren: The will might be challenged on grounds that it cannot override your rights as a legal heir under theHindu Succession Act. Since the grandchildren are now adults, the will's provisions regarding their rights might be irrelevant.Challenging Will: You and your brothers can potentially challenge the will. Being a witness in the will doesn't prevent S2 from inheriting, but the court will consider the circumstances.Current Landowners:Landowners' Rights: The current landowners might have some protection under \"bona fide purchaser\" principles if they bought the land without knowledge of any dispute. However, the specifics depend on the details of each sale.Limitation Period:Claiming Sold Property: Limitation period for property claims can vary depending on the nature of the suit. Consulting a lawyer is crucial to determine the applicable limitation period in your case. It might start from 2005 (sale year) or potentially from 2019 (when you learned about the land).Recommendation:Consult a lawyer specializing in property law in Andhra Pradesh. They can analyze the specific details of your case, including the will, sale deeds, and partition suit documents. Based on that, they can advise on the most suitable type of suit to file (partition, declaration, or something else) and the legal arguments with the strongest chance of success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It can be a family member, friend, or any individual willing to vouch for the accused's appearance in court6)person can stand surety to more than one accused person, but he needs to make a declaration regarding this before the Court.7) Courts insists production of property documents. Sometimes, in lieu of the same, Courts demand production of RC books of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, etc.8)some times an accused, who is an utter stranger to the area or he has no friends or relatives in the area or he could not secure a person to stand as surety can offer cash surety. The Court can accept cash surety, instead of personal surety. But the Court cannot demand personal surety, property surety and cash surety, at a time. It is not cumulative. It is alternative.9) you can go abroad for work purposes or education if no conditions are imposed by court while granting bailotherwise you need court permission to travel abroad10) fixed deposit can work as surety11) discharge is good optionAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98561 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Appearance before JIMC Court/Magistrate Court",
    "answer": "- As per law, you have right to seek bail ,and the court cannot dictate to withdraw the anticipatory bail application on any ground.- However, as you have granted bail from the I.O. then you should appear before the court for getting permanent bail i.e. to produce the surety from the court after filing the charge sheet by the I.O.1. Since, no charge sheet is filed then the court cannot issue notice/summon to you to appear and only after filing the charge sheet your appearance is required2. The I.O. is wrong , however you should apply for getting bail from the court , so that you may not be harassed by the I.O.3. Surety must be known person who has control over the accused , and hence your family members or friend can be a surety on your behalf.4. Yes, they can be surety if they are not appear in the same case on behalf of another accused.5. Yes, generally it ranges from 10,000/- to 25,000/-6. Yes, as the I.O. has already admitted the bail7.

    "question": "Regarding immigration",
    "answer": "There is no requirement to obtain NOC by Australian immigration for applying for skilled migrant visa to Australia.The demand for skilled workers in Australia is high. Both academic and (even more so) trade occupations are in high demand and have good prospects for obtaining an Australian visa.Qualified professionals in particular are offered visa subclasses based on a points-tested basis, as these often lead to a permanent residency with a work permit. The points-test-based visa subclass is an interesting option for qualified workers because these are predominantly permanent visas.This visa is available for individuals with specific qualifications and experience. The Australian Government analyses the future demand for skilled workers and publishes the relevant occupations on the Skilled Occupations Lists.A skills assessment is required prior to application for this visa. An assessing authority assesses whether the individual’s qualifications are applicable and relevant to the occupation in question.For this particular visa subclass, eligible skilled workers are in demand Australia-wide. As such, the Australian Government grants applicants permanent residency status immediately without certain residency and workplace requirements. This visa comes with a maximum of flexibility and freedom.The most important visa requirements at a glance:Aged under 45Valid passportSufficient English language skillsOccupation is listed on the relevant listSkills assessmentPoints-test requirementHealth checkCharacter requirements fulfilled (no severe convictions)No outstanding debts to the Commonwealth/li>No prior refusal or cancellation of an Australian visaVisa validity and essential visa conditions:Permanent visaMedicare accessFreedom of choice as to place of residence and place of workThus there is no requirement for NOC from Australian point of view.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"
