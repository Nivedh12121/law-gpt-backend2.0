    "answer": "it seems the 2 flats were sold by registered agreementsjust the share transfer forms were not signed by the sellerthe society can dispense with that requirement and admit the buyer as its member by entering his/her name in the share certificatefor the lost share certificate the buyer can lodge a FIR and issue a public notice in local newspaperthe FIR copy and public notice cut out can then be attached to an application to be signed by the buyer and the committee can agree to issue a duplicate share certificate and mutate the name of the buyer on itthe society is not disputing that the 2 flats were sold to the 2 buyersso why keep them hanging unnecessarily ?tracing the seller will be a task for the buyers. so please consider and relax the requirement of the share transfer forms.take adequate indemnities from the buyers to protect the society against any legal claims in future. that should suffice in my viewadmit the new buyers and make them participants in the society's affairs. that would indeed serve the 'co-operative' movement under the societies actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "The share certificate is not a title document to confirm the ownership of the proeprty to the owner.The share certificate is just recognise the owner as a member of the RWA.There is no such bylaw forbidding the new owner to become a member with an application for membership without the signature of the seller.The sellers might have sold the property and absconded to avoid payment of transfer fee to the society.The registrar has not insisted on NOC from the society to register the sale deed in favor of the buyer to purchase the property.All these indicate that these are not mandatory requirement  as per law, hence the society can use its discretion as an conceptional case to issue the transfer certificate in favor of the buyer without the signature of the seller.If the previous original share certificate has been reported to have been lost, then the formalities like a  police complaint, a public notice in a local newspaper and an indemnity bond from the member may be obtained to protect the future  the interests of the society.It is discretionary and not mandatory, hence you can take a decision after a meeting with the MC members about this  in case you feel that your individual decision may put you in trouble at a later stage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88763 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sure, here are the rewritten sentences:First flat:If the sale and purchase documents are intact and duly executed and registered, then the fact that the seller's signature is missing from the society's internal transfer document is not a valid reason to refuse to transfer the share in the name of the purchaser. The transfer document is an internal document of the society, and it is not legally binding.The sale and purchase documents are the legally binding documents, and they are sufficient to prove that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share. The society should not refuse to transfer the share based on the incomplete transfer document.Second flat:If the original share certificate is lost, then a police complaint must be filed to report the loss of the original. A public notice must also be published before a duplicate certificate can be issued. An affidavit to this effect should also be taken.The police complaint and public notice are necessary to ensure that the original share certificate is not being used by someone else. The affidavit is necessary to confirm that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will validity",
    "answer": "Intestate Succession: Since your father passed away without leaving a will, his properties, including the ancestral house and the shop, would be inherited by his legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The legal heirs in the case of a Hindu male dying intestate are his widow (your mother) and children (you and your brothers). The properties would be divided equally among the widow and the children.Ancestral Property: Ancestral property has a specific definition under Hindu law. It refers to property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage, and all male descendants in those generations have an equal right to it. If the second house is genuinely ancestral property, your father would have been a co-owner with his brothers, and upon his passing, his share would devolve upon his legal heirs, including his widow and children.Will and Partition: If your mother made a will where she purportedly transferred all the properties solely to one of your brothers, this action could potentially be challenged in court. The legality of the will and its validity would be subject to examination. Under Hindu law, a person has the right to bequeath their self-acquired property through a will, but the same principles do not apply to ancestral property. Ancestral property devolves through intestate succession and not through a will.Challenging the Will: To challenge the validity of the will, you may need to present evidence or raise objections on various grounds, such as the authenticity of the will, the mental capacity of your mother when making the will, coercion, undue influence, or fraud. Additionally, if the properties are indeed ancestral, the will's claim to transfer them exclusively to one brother may be legally untenable.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

If either parent is a direct Class 1 servant, their children are not eligible for NCL status, but if the parent is promoted to Class 1, the children become eligible. Similarly, if the father was initially recruited to Class 2 and later promoted to Class 1 before turning 40, NCL status will not apply. Government employees of Class 3 or below are eligible for OBC Quota, and their income is not considered when determining NCL status. As your father was directly recruited as Class B and promoted to Class A after the age of 40, you are entitled to obtain the OBC NCL certificate."

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will validity",
    "answer": "Intestate Succession: Since your father passed away without leaving a will, his properties, including the ancestral house and the shop, would be inherited by his legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The legal heirs in the case of a Hindu male dying intestate are his widow (your mother) and children (you and your brothers). The properties would be divided equally among the widow and the children.Ancestral Property: Ancestral property has a specific definition under Hindu law. It refers to property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage, and all male descendants in those generations have an equal right to it. If the second house is genuinely ancestral property, your father would have been a co-owner with his brothers, and upon his passing, his share would devolve upon his legal heirs, including his widow and children.Will and Partition: If your mother made a will where she purportedly transferred all the properties solely to one of your brothers, this action could potentially be challenged in court. The legality of the will and its validity would be subject to examination. Under Hindu law, a person has the right to bequeath their self-acquired property through a will, but the same principles do not apply to ancestral property. Ancestral property devolves through intestate succession and not through a will.Challenging the Will: To challenge the validity of the will, you may need to present evidence or raise objections on various grounds, such as the authenticity of the will, the mental capacity of your mother when making the will, coercion, undue influence, or fraud. Additionally, if the properties are indeed ancestral, the will's claim to transfer them exclusively to one brother may be legally untenable.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If either parent is a direct Class 1 servant, their children are not eligible for NCL status, but if the parent is promoted to Class 1, the children become eligible. Similarly, if the father was initially recruited to Class 2 and later promoted to Class 1 before turning 40, NCL status will not apply.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is not mandatory to go through mediation again in Bhubaneshwar court if you are not interested. However, the court may still order mediation if it feels that it would be helpful. If you choose not to go to mediation, the court may proceed with the divorce case without your consent.The court will also consider the fact that mediation has already failed in the Supreme Court. This may make it more likely that the court will order mediation in Bhubaneshwar. However, the final decision will be up to the judge.If you choose to fight the case, the court will likely hear arguments from both sides and then make a decision about whether to grant the divorce. The court will consider all of the relevant factors, including the reasons for the divorce, the evidence presented by both sides.It is important to speak to your lawyer about your options and to get their advice on how to proceed. he will be able to help you understand the law and the court's likely decision.Here are some of the possible consequences of choosing not to go to mediation in Bhubaneshwar:The court may order mediation anyway.The court may take longer to reach a decision.The court may be less likely to grant the divorce.It is important to weigh the pros and cons of mediation before making a decision.

    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

The society should not refuse to transfer the share based on the incomplete transfer document.Second flat:If the original share certificate is lost, then a police complaint must be filed to report the loss of the original. A public notice must also be published before a duplicate certificate can be issued. An affidavit to this effect should also be taken.The police complaint and public notice are necessary to ensure that the original share certificate is not being used by someone else. The affidavit is necessary to confirm that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

    "answer": "HUF meansHindu Undivided Family.A Hindu family can come together and form a HUF.HUF is usually used by families as a means to build assets.One person cannot form HUF, it can only be formed by a family.HUF usually has assets which come as a gift, a will, or ancestral property, or property acquired from the sale of joint family property or property contributed to the common pool by members of HUF.Once a HUF is formed it must be formally registered in its name. A HUF should have a legal deed. The deed shall contain details of HUF members and the business of the HUF. A PAN number and a bank account should be opened in the name of the HUF.Since your father is inheriting the property by a partition deed, he first has to get the property transferred to his name after which he can add it to the HUF.Please note that the grandfather's property is not ancestral in nature hence you cannot claim a share in your grandfather's property as a right.  Therefore the property inherited by your father through the partition becomes his own and absolute property.The head of a HUF is called the Karta, he is the senior-most male member of the family.The HUF being a separate taxable assessee, can claim a deduction under section 80C.

    "question": "Transfer of ancestral property to HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the proper transfer and registration of ancestral property, it is recommended that your father follows these steps:Your father should initiate the process of transferring his share of the ancestral property in his name. This involves executing a deed of partition that clearly outlines the distribution of shares among the co-owners. The deed of partition should be appropriately stamped and registered with the relevant authorities to make it legally valid.Once your father's share of the property is transferred and registered in his name, he can proceed to form a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). The HUF will consist of your father, your mother, and yourself. It's important to note that the property in question is ancestral property, which means it has been inherited through generations.Although the property may not be explicitly mentioned as HUF property in official records, the formation of the HUF can still be established based on the ancestral nature of the property and the HUF's existence in practice. Your father should ensure that he receives his rightful share of the property as per the partition deed before forming the HUF.It is advisable to consult a Chartered Accountant (CA) to understand the tax implications associated with the formation of an HUF. The CA will provide guidance on matters such as income tax, capital gains tax, and any other relevant tax considerations.To register the property in the name of the HUF, your father needs to prepare a deed of HUF, which outlines the formation of the HUF and includes the details of its members. Additionally, a PAN Card in the name of the HUF is required. These documents should be prepared and submitted as part of the registration process to establish the property as HUF property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the question that arises is with regard to terms of Section 5 of the Act which enables any interested person to make an application for having the transfer annulled as void under Section 4 of the Act. This Section does not prescribe any period within which such an application can be made. Neither does it prescribe the period within which suo motu action may be taken. This Court in the case of Chhedi Lal Yadav & Ors. vs. Hari Kishore Yadav (D) Thr. Lrs. & Ors., 2017(6) SCALE 459 and also in the case of Ningappa vs. Dy. Commissioner & Ors. (C.A.

    "question": "Transfer of ancestral property to HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the proper transfer and registration of ancestral property, it is recommended that your father follows these steps:Your father should initiate the process of transferring his share of the ancestral property in his name. This involves executing a deed of partition that clearly outlines the distribution of shares among the co-owners. The deed of partition should be appropriately stamped and registered with the relevant authorities to make it legally valid.Once your father's share of the property is transferred and registered in his name, he can proceed to form a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). The HUF will consist of your father, your mother, and yourself. It's important to note that the property in question is ancestral property, which means it has been inherited through generations.Although the property may not be explicitly mentioned as HUF property in official records, the formation of the HUF can still be established based on the ancestral nature of the property and the HUF's existence in practice. Your father should ensure that he receives his rightful share of the property as per the partition deed before forming the HUF.It is advisable to consult a Chartered Accountant (CA) to understand the tax implications associated with the formation of an HUF. The CA will provide guidance on matters such as income tax, capital gains tax, and any other relevant tax considerations.To register the property in the name of the HUF, your father needs to prepare a deed of HUF, which outlines the formation of the HUF and includes the details of its members. Additionally, a PAN Card in the name of the HUF is required. These documents should be prepared and submitted as part of the registration process to establish the property as HUF property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Honble Supreme Court in the case ofNEKKANTI RAMA LAKSHMI vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHERreported in2017 SCC Online SC 1862has held as hereunder: 8. However, the question that arises is with regard to terms of Section 5 of the Act which enables any interested person to make an application for having the transfer annulled as void under Section 4 of the Act. This Section does not prescribe any period within which such an application can be made. Neither does it prescribe the period within which suo motu action may be taken. This Court in the case of Chhedi Lal Yadav & Ors. vs. Hari Kishore Yadav (D) Thr. Lrs. & Ors., 2017(6) SCALE 459 and also in the case of Ningappa vs. Dy. Commissioner & Ors. (C.A. No. 3131 of 2007, decided on 14.07.2011) reiterated a settled position in law that whether Statute provided for a period of limitation, provisions of the Statute must be invoked within a reasonable time. It is held that action whether on an application of the parties, or suo motu, must be taken within a reasonable time2) state legislature can amend the law to provide limitation period in PTCL actAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98565 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Transfer of ancestral property to HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the proper transfer and registration of ancestral property, it is recommended that your father follows these steps:Your father should initiate the process of transferring his share of the ancestral property in his name. This involves executing a deed of partition that clearly outlines the distribution of shares among the co-owners. The deed of partition should be appropriately stamped and registered with the relevant authorities to make it legally valid.Once your father's share of the property is transferred and registered in his name, he can proceed to form a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). The HUF will consist of your father, your mother, and yourself. It's important to note that the property in question is ancestral property, which means it has been inherited through generations.Although the property may not be explicitly mentioned as HUF property in official records, the formation of the HUF can still be established based on the ancestral nature of the property and the HUF's existence in practice. Your father should ensure that he receives his rightful share of the property as per the partition deed before forming the HUF.It is advisable to consult a Chartered Accountant (CA) to understand the tax implications associated with the formation of an HUF. The CA will provide guidance on matters such as income tax, capital gains tax, and any other relevant tax considerations.To register the property in the name of the HUF, your father needs to prepare a deed of HUF, which outlines the formation of the HUF and includes the details of its members. Additionally, a PAN Card in the name of the HUF is required. These documents should be prepared and submitted as part of the registration process to establish the property as HUF property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It appears that you and the other co-owners have the freedom to sell your undivided shares in the land, assuming there is no restraining order in place and the preliminary decree for partition has not been issued yet.In the event of a sale, the court may appoint a commissioner to divide the land into specific portions based on measurements and boundaries.It is important to note that selling your undivided share may potentially require reopening the preliminary decree, but this decision lies with the presiding judge overseeing the case. Additionally, if the court determines that shares have already been allocated to co-owners who have sold their interests to subsequent transferees, and there is no reason to challenge this allocation, the court may choose not to reopen the matter. Instead, the court may proceed to allot shares to the proposed transferees as necessary. However, these matters will be determined by the court based on the available evidence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Problems arises only in the properties which are indivisible like a single unit house/flat which cannot be divided as per the local laws.

    "question": "Transfer of ancestral property to HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the proper transfer and registration of ancestral property, it is recommended that your father follows these steps:Your father should initiate the process of transferring his share of the ancestral property in his name. This involves executing a deed of partition that clearly outlines the distribution of shares among the co-owners. The deed of partition should be appropriately stamped and registered with the relevant authorities to make it legally valid.Once your father's share of the property is transferred and registered in his name, he can proceed to form a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). The HUF will consist of your father, your mother, and yourself. It's important to note that the property in question is ancestral property, which means it has been inherited through generations.Although the property may not be explicitly mentioned as HUF property in official records, the formation of the HUF can still be established based on the ancestral nature of the property and the HUF's existence in practice. Your father should ensure that he receives his rightful share of the property as per the partition deed before forming the HUF.It is advisable to consult a Chartered Accountant (CA) to understand the tax implications associated with the formation of an HUF. The CA will provide guidance on matters such as income tax, capital gains tax, and any other relevant tax considerations.To register the property in the name of the HUF, your father needs to prepare a deed of HUF, which outlines the formation of the HUF and includes the details of its members. Additionally, a PAN Card in the name of the HUF is required. These documents should be prepared and submitted as part of the registration process to establish the property as HUF property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The child is a US citizen, hence if he obtains a custody order, he can very well execute the same in India.The Indian Courts have the power to entertain the case of custody of a child of foreign nationality.The Court although has to comply with the doctrine of judicial comity and legal statutes such as the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.2. The procedures in each country differs with each other in respect of the matrimonial disputes, hence you have to endure the same accordinlgy.3. Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is essential to the whole assimilation of all the codified laws to deal with these cases. The Section says that the decree or order made by a foreign court shall be enforceable if it is conclusive. Conclusiveness of a decree or order where the parties and claims made by them in such case can be figured if it is not made of such factors-Court pronouncing the judgment is not competent or lacks the jurisdiction.If it is not given on the merits of the case i.e. based on the provisions that provide for such cases.When the international law is not followed or the recognition of Indian law when necessary is not taken into account in the proceedings of the case on the face of it.If the laws followed or grounds on which the judgement is given is in contravention to the Principle of Natural Justice.If the case is framed and the decree is obtained by fraud.If the claim obtained is found to be in contravention of Indian laws.Similarly, if the custody of a child decree must be made while keeping all these factors into account then only it could be enforced in India.

    "answer": "HUF meansHindu Undivided Family.A Hindu family can come together and form a HUF.HUF is usually used by families as a means to build assets.One person cannot form HUF, it can only be formed by a family.HUF usually has assets which come as a gift, a will, or ancestral property, or property acquired from the sale of joint family property or property contributed to the common pool by members of HUF.Once a HUF is formed it must be formally registered in its name. A HUF should have a legal deed. The deed shall contain details of HUF members and the business of the HUF. A PAN number and a bank account should be opened in the name of the HUF.Since your father is inheriting the property by a partition deed, he first has to get the property transferred to his name after which he can add it to the HUF.Please note that the grandfather's property is not ancestral in nature hence you cannot claim a share in your grandfather's property as a right.  Therefore the property inherited by your father through the partition becomes his own and absolute property.The head of a HUF is called the Karta, he is the senior-most male member of the family.The HUF being a separate taxable assessee, can claim a deduction under section 80C.

    "question": "Transfer of ancestral property to HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the proper transfer and registration of ancestral property, it is recommended that your father follows these steps:Your father should initiate the process of transferring his share of the ancestral property in his name. This involves executing a deed of partition that clearly outlines the distribution of shares among the co-owners. The deed of partition should be appropriately stamped and registered with the relevant authorities to make it legally valid.Once your father's share of the property is transferred and registered in his name, he can proceed to form a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). The HUF will consist of your father, your mother, and yourself. It's important to note that the property in question is ancestral property, which means it has been inherited through generations.Although the property may not be explicitly mentioned as HUF property in official records, the formation of the HUF can still be established based on the ancestral nature of the property and the HUF's existence in practice. Your father should ensure that he receives his rightful share of the property as per the partition deed before forming the HUF.It is advisable to consult a Chartered Accountant (CA) to understand the tax implications associated with the formation of an HUF. The CA will provide guidance on matters such as income tax, capital gains tax, and any other relevant tax considerations.To register the property in the name of the HUF, your father needs to prepare a deed of HUF, which outlines the formation of the HUF and includes the details of its members. Additionally, a PAN Card in the name of the HUF is required. These documents should be prepared and submitted as part of the registration process to establish the property as HUF property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, assuming it to be so:1) Was the man's brother alive when the partition was made in 1987? Because, the partition should have taken place only between the two brothers then living. As you say, the man divided the property with his nephew (assuming him to be his brother's son), it implies that the man's brother had died by then. Based on these assumed facts, the partition seems to be in order.2) Yes, he was well within his rights to have gifted his share.3) No, her claim is not tenable legally.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Family Law Religion: Muslim",
    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common.

    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common. However, the laws are meant to ensure fair treatment for both parties based on the specific circumstances of the case. It's not advisable for anyone to give up without seeking legal advice and exploring available options. Sometimes, out-of-court settlements through mediation or negotiation might be more beneficial for both parties.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The courts also have duty to see that the records are true and present the correct state of affair. There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that the court cannot exercise the said jurisdiction so as to review its judgment. It cannot also exercise its jurisdiction when no mistake or slip occurred in the decree or order. This provision, in our opinion, should, however, not be construed in a pedantic manner. A decree may, therefore, be corrected by the Court both in exercise of its power under Section 152 as also under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such a power of the court is well recognized.5) make an application for amendment of LA for removal of Mrs R as administratorAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98565 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Legality of Letter of Administration with the Copy of  Will",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An application can be made to the Court for the amendment of the Letters of Administration in order to remove Mrs. R as the administrator. This request is based on the fact that she is not a beneficiary of the will, which makes her ineligible for the role. The Indian Succession Act, specifically Section 261, allows for rectifying errors in names, descriptions, and other details in the grant of probate or letters of administration. Furthermore, Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to correct its own errors, accidental slips, or omissions in judgments, decrees, or orders. The Court's inherent power under the Code of Civil Procedure also encompasses the duty to ensure the accuracy of records. It is important to note that this application for amendment should not be construed rigidly, as the Court has the authority to correct decrees and exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 152 and 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The principle behind the said provision is actus curiae nemesis gravabit, i.e., nobody shall be prejudiced by an act of court.4) Code of Civil Procedure recognises the inherent power of the court. It is not only confined to the amendment of the judgment or decree as envisaged under Section 152 of the code but also inherent power in general. The courts also have duty to see that the records are true and present the correct state of affair. There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that the court cannot exercise the said jurisdiction so as to review its judgment. It cannot also exercise its jurisdiction when no mistake or slip occurred in the decree or order. This provision, in our opinion, should, however, not be construed in a pedantic manner. A decree may, therefore, be corrected by the Court both in exercise of its power under Section 152 as also under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

This request is based on the fact that she is not a beneficiary of the will, which makes her ineligible for the role.

Furthermore, Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to correct its own errors, accidental slips, or omissions in judgments, decrees, or orders. The Court's inherent power under the Code of Civil Procedure also encompasses the duty to ensure the accuracy of records.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Once the lease had already expired at the time of sealing the property, it is evident that the tenant has no legal right to continue occupying the house after the sealing process. Additionally, it is essential to serve a legal notice to terminate the tenancy, which is a mandatory step in such cases. By sending the notice of termination prior to filing the petition with the court, the tenant is prevented from taking possession of the premises. Thus, when the court de-seals the property, it becomes necessary for you to assume possession of the said property. It is important to note that taking possession in this manner does not violate the stay order or status quo order.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Wife of R cannot be named as administrator as she is not beneficiary of the will2) section 261 of Indian succession act providesWhat errors may be rectified by Court.- Errors in names and descriptions, or in setting forth the time and place of the deceased's death or the purpose in a limited grant, may be rectified by the Court and the grant of probate or letters of administration may be altered and amended accordingly.\"3)Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to correct its own error in a judgment, decree or order from any accidental slip or omission. The principle behind the said provision is actus curiae nemesis gravabit, i.e., nobody shall be prejudiced by an act of court.4) Code of Civil Procedure recognises the inherent power of the court. It is not only confined to the amendment of the judgment or decree as envisaged under Section 152 of the code but also inherent power in general. The courts also have duty to see that the records are true and present the correct state of affair. There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that the court cannot exercise the said jurisdiction so as to review its judgment. It cannot also exercise its jurisdiction when no mistake or slip occurred in the decree or order. This provision, in our opinion, should, however, not be construed in a pedantic manner. A decree may, therefore, be corrected by the Court both in exercise of its power under Section 152 as also under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such a power of the court is well recognized.5) make an application for amendment of LA for removal of Mrs R as administratorAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98565 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,An application can be made to the Court for the amendment of the Letters of Administration in order to remove Mrs. R as the administrator. This request is based on the fact that she is not a beneficiary of the will, which makes her ineligible for the role. The Indian Succession Act, specifically Section 261, allows for rectifying errors in names, descriptions, and other details in the grant of probate or letters of administration. Furthermore, Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to correct its own errors, accidental slips, or omissions in judgments, decrees, or orders. The Court's inherent power under the Code of Civil Procedure also encompasses the duty to ensure the accuracy of records. It is important to note that this application for amendment should not be construed rigidly, as the Court has the authority to correct decrees and exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 152 and 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Additionally, it is essential to serve a legal notice to terminate the tenancy, which is a mandatory step in such cases.

The principle behind the said provision is actus curiae nemesis gravabit, i.e., nobody shall be prejudiced by an act of court.4) Code of Civil Procedure recognises the inherent power of the court. It is not only confined to the amendment of the judgment or decree as envisaged under Section 152 of the code but also inherent power in general. The courts also have duty to see that the records are true and present the correct state of affair. There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that the court cannot exercise the said jurisdiction so as to review its judgment. It cannot also exercise its jurisdiction when no mistake or slip occurred in the decree or order. This provision, in our opinion, should, however, not be construed in a pedantic manner. A decree may, therefore, be corrected by the Court both in exercise of its power under Section 152 as also under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

This request is based on the fact that she is not a beneficiary of the will, which makes her ineligible for the role. The Indian Succession Act, specifically Section 261, allows for rectifying errors in names, descriptions, and other details in the grant of probate or letters of administration. Furthermore, Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to correct its own errors, accidental slips, or omissions in judgments, decrees, or orders. The Court's inherent power under the Code of Civil Procedure also encompasses the duty to ensure the accuracy of records. It is important to note that this application for amendment should not be construed rigidly, as the Court has the authority to correct decrees and exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 152 and 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Additionally, it is essential to serve a legal notice to terminate the tenancy, which is a mandatory step in such cases. By sending the notice of termination prior to filing the petition with the court, the tenant is prevented from taking possession of the premises.

    "question": "Permission for sale of house",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Government servants are required to obtain permission from their department before selling any immovable property.This includes property owned by the government servant themselves, as well as property owned by any member of their family.If a government servant fails to obtain permission before selling property, they may be subject to disciplinary action.This could include a warning, suspension, or even dismissal from their job.The reason for this rule is to prevent government servants from using their position to gain an unfair advantage in property transactions.For example, a government servant might be able to buy property at a below-market price if they know that a sale is coming up.The rule also helps to ensure that government servants are not involved in conflicts of interest.For example, a government servant who is responsible for approving property deals should not be able to sell property themselves.If you are a government servant and you are considering selling property, you should first contact your department to get permission.This will help to ensure that you are in compliance with the rules and that you avoid any potential disciplinary action.Here is a more concise version:Government servants must obtain permission from their department before selling any immovable property.Failure to do so could result in disciplinary action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The principle behind the said provision is actus curiae nemesis gravabit, i.e., nobody shall be prejudiced by an act of court.4) Code of Civil Procedure recognises the inherent power of the court. It is not only confined to the amendment of the judgment or decree as envisaged under Section 152 of the code but also inherent power in general. The courts also have duty to see that the records are true and present the correct state of affair. There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that the court cannot exercise the said jurisdiction so as to review its judgment. It cannot also exercise its jurisdiction when no mistake or slip occurred in the decree or order. This provision, in our opinion, should, however, not be construed in a pedantic manner. A decree may, therefore, be corrected by the Court both in exercise of its power under Section 152 as also under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

    "answer": "The contents of the court order were reproduced within quotation marks \".....\" under point no. 2 of your query. Under point no. 3, there were no such marks. This has led to improper understanding of your query. Please present your facts correctly to enable learned lawyers to study the case and advise you properly.The court order is legally incorrect. The LoA should have been issued solely in the name of the legatee under the Will, as the court is duty-bound to honour a dead person's last wish as reflected in his Will. Whatever the legatee's age or health, no court can go beyond the letter of the Will.Apply to the same court for rectification of its erroneous order or appeal against it within the limitation, in consultation with your counsel.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "question": "Legality of Letter of Administration with the Copy of  Will",
    "answer": "It appears that you filed an erroneous application seeking a letter of authority (LOA) for multiple legatees, even though the will only names one legatee. This was an error on your part, and could even be considered as misleading the court.If Mrs. R was an authorized representative of Mr. R, and there was a proper mention of the power of attorney deed in favor of Mrs. R along with the application, then this could be considered as an error. Since this is a patent error, you can file a petition with the same court to rectify the judgment/order accordingly and obtain a rectified judgment.However, without seeing the order copy or knowing the full details of the petition, it is not possible to give any further opinion, as this could lead to further misleading information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Additionally, it is essential to serve a legal notice to terminate the tenancy, which is a mandatory step in such cases.

The principle behind the said provision is actus curiae nemesis gravabit, i.e., nobody shall be prejudiced by an act of court.4) Code of Civil Procedure recognises the inherent power of the court. It is not only confined to the amendment of the judgment or decree as envisaged under Section 152 of the code but also inherent power in general. The courts also have duty to see that the records are true and present the correct state of affair. There cannot, however, be any doubt whatsoever that the court cannot exercise the said jurisdiction so as to review its judgment. It cannot also exercise its jurisdiction when no mistake or slip occurred in the decree or order. This provision, in our opinion, should, however, not be construed in a pedantic manner. A decree may, therefore, be corrected by the Court both in exercise of its power under Section 152 as also under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such a power of the court is well recognized.5) make an application for amendment of LA for removal of Mrs R as administratorAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98565 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

This request is based on the fact that she is not a beneficiary of the will, which makes her ineligible for the role. The Indian Succession Act, specifically Section 261, allows for rectifying errors in names, descriptions, and other details in the grant of probate or letters of administration. Furthermore, Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers the Court to correct its own errors, accidental slips, or omissions in judgments, decrees, or orders. The Court's inherent power under the Code of Civil Procedure also encompasses the duty to ensure the accuracy of records. It is important to note that this application for amendment should not be construed rigidly, as the Court has the authority to correct decrees and exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 152 and 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Additionally, it is essential to serve a legal notice to terminate the tenancy, which is a mandatory step in such cases. By sending the notice of termination prior to filing the petition with the court, the tenant is prevented from taking possession of the premises. Thus, when the court de-seals the property, it becomes necessary for you to assume possession of the said property.

    "question": "Expired tenant threatening to take hostile possession of the property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Once the lease had already expired at the time of sealing the property, it is evident that the tenant has no legal right to continue occupying the house after the sealing process. Additionally, it is essential to serve a legal notice to terminate the tenancy, which is a mandatory step in such cases. By sending the notice of termination prior to filing the petition with the court, the tenant is prevented from taking possession of the premises. Thus, when the court de-seals the property, it becomes necessary for you to assume possession of the said property.

Only a registered sale deed is a title document.If the property has been transferred to you through a registered sale deed, then you are the legal owner of the property. In this case, a third party cannot claim any portion of the property.Similarly, if you have a registered general power of attorney (GPA) with possession of the property, then you are also the legal owner of the property.A promise to give land is not enough, and even an unregistered agreement does not have any value in the eyes of the law.Therefore, you should take possession of the entire land. If a third party interrupts you, you should file an injunction suit in court to restrain them from interfering with your property.Here are some additional points to keep in mind:A registered sale deed is a public document that is recorded in the government registry. This makes it a more reliable and secure way to transfer ownership of property.A GPA is a document that gives you the power to act on someone else's behalf. If you have a registered GPA with possession of property, then you have the right to occupy and use the property as if you were the owner.An injunction is a court order that prohibits someone from doing something.

(1) Person who is a necessary party i.e., in the absence of whom relief claimed in the suit cannot be granted.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Supreme Court, a power of attorney (POA) or a sale agreement is not a title document for property. Only a registered sale deed is a title document.If the property has been transferred to you through a registered sale deed, then you are the legal owner of the property. In this case, a third party cannot claim any portion of the property.Similarly, if you have a registered general power of attorney (GPA) with possession of the property, then you are also the legal owner of the property.A promise to give land is not enough, and even an unregistered agreement does not have any value in the eyes of the law.Therefore, you should take possession of the entire land. If a third party interrupts you, you should file an injunction suit in court to restrain them from interfering with your property.Here are some additional points to keep in mind:A registered sale deed is a public document that is recorded in the government registry. This makes it a more reliable and secure way to transfer ownership of property.A GPA is a document that gives you the power to act on someone else's behalf. If you have a registered GPA with possession of property, then you have the right to occupy and use the property as if you were the owner.An injunction is a court order that prohibits someone from doing something.

(1) Person who is a necessary party i.e., in the absence of whom relief claimed in the suit cannot be granted. In other words, it means that for the grant of relief claimed in a suit, a person who ought to have joined must be added, (2) the second class of persons consists of those who are proper parties i.e., whose presence may be necessary with a view to fully adjudicate upon the matters involved in the suitIn Kasturi vs., Uyyamperumal and others (2005) Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that “it is nowclear that two tests are to be satisfied for determining the question who is a necessary party. Tests are - (1) there must be a right to some relief against such party in respect of the controversies involved in the proceedings (2) no effective decree can be passed in the absence of such party.”Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Supreme Court, a power of attorney (POA) or a sale agreement is not a title document for property. Only a registered sale deed is a title document.If the property has been transferred to you through a registered sale deed, then you are the legal owner of the property. In this case, a third party cannot claim any portion of the property.Similarly, if you have a registered general power of attorney (GPA) with possession of the property, then you are also the legal owner of the property.A promise to give land is not enough, and even an unregistered agreement does not have any value in the eyes of the law.Therefore, you should take possession of the entire land. If a third party interrupts you, you should file an injunction suit in court to restrain them from interfering with your property.Here are some additional points to keep in mind:A registered sale deed is a public document that is recorded in the government registry. This makes it a more reliable and secure way to transfer ownership of property.A GPA is a document that gives you the power to act on someone else's behalf. If you have a registered GPA with possession of property, then you have the right to occupy and use the property as if you were the owner.An injunction is a court order that prohibits someone from doing something. If you file an injunction suit against a third party who is interfering with your property, the court can order them to stop.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Agreement",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Registration of a sale agreement, expressing willingness to sell a property to a particular person on receiving full payment in future, will not be a bar for the property owner to go ahead and sell or transfer the property to a third party without getting the sale agreement annulled through a civil court decree.Seller has chosen to sale the property without your consent and knowledge.Since you the registered sale deed in your favour therefore you can seek the impleadment the case and seek for damages and compliance of the agreement.There are two types of persons who may be added as party to the suit. (1) Person who is a necessary party i.e., in the absence of whom relief claimed in the suit cannot be granted. In other words, it means that for the grant of relief claimed in a suit, a person who ought to have joined must be added, (2) the second class of persons consists of those who are proper parties i.e., whose presence may be necessary with a view to fully adjudicate upon the matters involved in the suitIn Kasturi vs., Uyyamperumal and others (2005) Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that “it is nowclear that two tests are to be satisfied for determining the question who is a necessary party. Tests are - (1) there must be a right to some relief against such party in respect of the controversies involved in the proceedings (2) no effective decree can be passed in the absence of such party.”Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the ground that by introducing the Unit Area Method (UAM), these Bye-laws sought to alter the earlier system of determining the rateable value on the basis of the annual rent at which the land or buildings may reasonably be expected to be let from year to year....2) The ‘rateable value’, as per Section 2(42) of the NDMC Act is to be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Bye-laws made thereunder. Section 63(1) deals with determination of annual rent of a property. This annual rent has to be the one which the land or the property ‘might reasonably be expected to let from year to year’. It is, thus, based on the letting yearly value of the property. Based on various judgments of this Court, it was noticed that the only basis for fixation of rateable value is the annual rent at which the land or building might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, subject to the deductions provided under the NDMC Act...3) The Impugned Bye-laws that provide UAM, which is based on the annual value of the property, are foreign to the methodology provided in Section 63 of the NDMC Act.

The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the grounds that they violated the New Delhi Municipal Act, 1944 (NDMC Act).The NDMC Bye-Laws introduced a new method for determining the rateable value of properties, called the Unit Area Method (UAM). The UAM is based on the annual value of the property, rather than the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court found that the UAM was not in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act. The Act specifically states that the rateable value of a property is to be determined on the basis of the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court's decision means that the NDMC Bye-Laws will no longer be used to determine the rateable value of properties in Delhi. The rateable value of properties will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act.The NDMC Bye-Laws were in force from 2009 to 2017.

    "answer": "You are right in your views about the MCD in connection with the assessment of property tax isThe formula used for calculation is as follows:Property tax = Annual value x Rate of taxWhere Annual value = Unit area value per sq metre x Unit area of property x Age factor x Use factor x Structure factor x Occupancy factor..In the impugned judgment, Delhi High Court accepted the submission of the assessees holding that the impugned Bye-laws are ultra vires the NDMC Act as they are far beyond the scope and ambit of the powers vested in NDMC under Section 388(1)(A)(9) of the Act which gives rule making power to the NDMC.SC observed that these Bye-law were framed in the year 2009 and they were struck down by the High Court vide impugned judgment dated 10th August, 2017. That at present, 95% of the assessees have paid their tax as per Byelaws 2009. In these circumstances, to upset the applecart completely may not be appropriate. In such a peculiar situation, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Apex Court directs that those assessees who have paid the tax as per Bye-Laws, 2009, their assessments shall not be reopened. However, it will not apply to the respondents namely, those assessees who were the writ petitioners in the High Court. In their cases, the direction given by the High Court in the impugned judgment shall prevail.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Supreme Court, a power of attorney (POA) or a sale agreement is not a title document for property. Only a registered sale deed is a title document.If the property has been transferred to you through a registered sale deed, then you are the legal owner of the property. In this case, a third party cannot claim any portion of the property.Similarly, if you have a registered general power of attorney (GPA) with possession of the property, then you are also the legal owner of the property.A promise to give land is not enough, and even an unregistered agreement does not have any value in the eyes of the law.Therefore, you should take possession of the entire land. If a third party interrupts you, you should file an injunction suit in court to restrain them from interfering with your property.Here are some additional points to keep in mind:A registered sale deed is a public document that is recorded in the government registry. This makes it a more reliable and secure way to transfer ownership of property.A GPA is a document that gives you the power to act on someone else's behalf. If you have a registered GPA with possession of property, then you have the right to occupy and use the property as if you were the owner.An injunction is a court order that prohibits someone from doing something. If you file an injunction suit against a third party who is interfering with your property, the court can order them to stop.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Registration of a sale agreement, expressing willingness to sell a property to a particular person on receiving full payment in future, will not be a bar for the property owner to go ahead and sell or transfer the property to a third party without getting the sale agreement annulled through a civil court decree.Seller has chosen to sale the property without your consent and knowledge.Since you the registered sale deed in your favour therefore you can seek the impleadment the case and seek for damages and compliance of the agreement.There are two types of persons who may be added as party to the suit. (1) Person who is a necessary party i.e., in the absence of whom relief claimed in the suit cannot be granted. In other words, it means that for the grant of relief claimed in a suit, a person who ought to have joined must be added, (2) the second class of persons consists of those who are proper parties i.e., whose presence may be necessary with a view to fully adjudicate upon the matters involved in the suitIn Kasturi vs., Uyyamperumal and others (2005) Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that “it is nowclear that two tests are to be satisfied for determining the question who is a necessary party. Tests are - (1) there must be a right to some relief against such party in respect of the controversies involved in the proceedings (2) no effective decree can be passed in the absence of such party.”Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Supreme Court, a power of attorney (POA) or a sale agreement is not a title document for property. Only a registered sale deed is a title document.If the property has been transferred to you through a registered sale deed, then you are the legal owner of the property. In this case, a third party cannot claim any portion of the property.Similarly, if you have a registered general power of attorney (GPA) with possession of the property, then you are also the legal owner of the property.A promise to give land is not enough, and even an unregistered agreement does not have any value in the eyes of the law.Therefore, you should take possession of the entire land. If a third party interrupts you, you should file an injunction suit in court to restrain them from interfering with your property.Here are some additional points to keep in mind:A registered sale deed is a public document that is recorded in the government registry. This makes it a more reliable and secure way to transfer ownership of property.A GPA is a document that gives you the power to act on someone else's behalf. If you have a registered GPA with possession of property, then you have the right to occupy and use the property as if you were the owner.An injunction is a court order that prohibits someone from doing something. If you file an injunction suit against a third party who is interfering with your property, the court can order them to stop.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  If the appeal was withdrawn by the appellants then there is no question of the appeal suit  anymore.2. The respondents have transferred their share in the property by executing a release deed, which clearly indicates that they have accepted the preliminary decree passed by the concerned court.3. If the appeal has been withdrawn then where is the question of the same being dismissed for default.4. If the appeal was withdrawn then they have to file a fresh appeal only but it would be barred by imitation and if they have not sought the leave of the court for filing fresh appeal, then the fresh appeal would be considered as res-judicata hence not maintainable.5.

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

They first have to get themselves impleaded as parties to the appeal after which they can think about the maintainability of the proposed challenge to the exparte decision of the condone delay petition.3. When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5. The court will implead the LRs but the challenge against the decision to condone the delay may not be entertained by court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share.

A will is a legal document that specifies how a person's property should be distributed after their death. If your father's will bequeathed the property to you, then that is the law. Your uncles cannot contest the will unless they can prove that it was forged or that your father was not of sound mind when he signed it.The fact that you have a daughter does not affect your right to the property. Under theHindu Succession Act, 1956, daughters have equal rights to property as sons. This means that your daughter will also inherit a share of the property, but that share will come after your share.If your uncles are still trying to re-partition the property, you should consult with a lawyer.

Subsequently, the property was mutated into your name, and you have obtained patta and passbook for the property.If the property was gifted to you through a registered Will, then the disposition of the property will be governed by the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act states that any property which is bequeathed by a Will takes effect upon the death of the testator. Therefore, upon your father's death, the gift of the property through the Will will become operational.If the property has already been mutated in your name and you have obtained the necessary documents and records, it would be difficult for your uncles to challenge the mutation or seek re-partition of the property. However, it is important to consult with a lawyer and thoroughly review the terms of the Will to ensure that all legal aspects have been properly followed.In case your uncles challenge the validity of the Will or your right to the property, you may need to approach a civil court to seek a declaration of your rights and protection of your interests.

    "question": "Calculation of property tax",
    "answer": "The Bench of Dr. AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, JJ has declared the New Delhi Municipal Council (Determination of Annual Rent) Bye-laws, 2009 (NDMC Bye-Laws) violative of the New Delhi Municipal Act, 1944 (NDMC Act). The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the ground that by introducing the Unit Area Method (UAM), these Bye-laws sought to alter the earlier system of determining the rateable value on the basis of the annual rent at which the land or buildings may reasonably be expected to be let from year to year....2) The ‘rateable value’, as per Section 2(42) of the NDMC Act is to be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Bye-laws made thereunder. Section 63(1) deals with determination of annual rent of a property. This annual rent has to be the one which the land or the property ‘might reasonably be expected to let from year to year’.

    "question": "Calculation of property tax",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Delhi High Court has declared the New Delhi Municipal Council (Determination of Annual Rent) Bye-laws, 2009 (NDMC Bye-Laws) to be invalid. The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the grounds that they violated the New Delhi Municipal Act, 1944 (NDMC Act).The NDMC Bye-Laws introduced a new method for determining the rateable value of properties, called the Unit Area Method (UAM). The UAM is based on the annual value of the property, rather than the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court found that the UAM was not in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act. The Act specifically states that the rateable value of a property is to be determined on the basis of the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court's decision means that the NDMC Bye-Laws will no longer be used to determine the rateable value of properties in Delhi. The rateable value of properties will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act.The NDMC Bye-Laws were in force from 2009 to 2017. They were struck down by the High Court in August 2017.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A will is a legal document that specifies how a person's property should be distributed after their death. If your father's will bequeathed the property to you, then that is the law. Your uncles cannot contest the will unless they can prove that it was forged or that your father was not of sound mind when he signed it.The fact that you have a daughter does not affect your right to the property. Under theHindu Succession Act, 1956, daughters have equal rights to property as sons. This means that your daughter will also inherit a share of the property, but that share will come after your share.If your uncles are still trying to re-partition the property, you should consult with a lawyer.

    "answer": "As per the information provided, it appears that your father gave his share of an inherited property to you through a valid registered Will deed. Subsequently, the property was mutated into your name, and you have obtained patta and passbook for the property.If the property was gifted to you through a registered Will, then the disposition of the property will be governed by the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act states that any property which is bequeathed by a Will takes effect upon the death of the testator. Therefore, upon your father's death, the gift of the property through the Will will become operational.If the property has already been mutated in your name and you have obtained the necessary documents and records, it would be difficult for your uncles to challenge the mutation or seek re-partition of the property. However, it is important to consult with a lawyer and thoroughly review the terms of the Will to ensure that all legal aspects have been properly followed.In case your uncles challenge the validity of the Will or your right to the property, you may need to approach a civil court to seek a declaration of your rights and protection of your interests. The specific jurisdiction of the court will depend on the location of the property.Narendra Singh JadonAdvocate, Alwar10 AnswersTalk to Advocate Narendra Singh Jadon"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Delhi High Court has declared the New Delhi Municipal Council (Determination of Annual Rent) Bye-laws, 2009 (NDMC Bye-Laws) to be invalid. The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the grounds that they violated the New Delhi Municipal Act, 1944 (NDMC Act).The NDMC Bye-Laws introduced a new method for determining the rateable value of properties, called the Unit Area Method (UAM). The UAM is based on the annual value of the property, rather than the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court found that the UAM was not in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act. The Act specifically states that the rateable value of a property is to be determined on the basis of the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court's decision means that the NDMC Bye-Laws will no longer be used to determine the rateable value of properties in Delhi. The rateable value of properties will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act.The NDMC Bye-Laws were in force from 2009 to 2017. They were struck down by the High Court in August 2017.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Calculation of property tax",
    "answer": "You are right in your views about the MCD in connection with the assessment of property tax isThe formula used for calculation is as follows:Property tax = Annual value x Rate of taxWhere Annual value = Unit area value per sq metre x Unit area of property x Age factor x Use factor x Structure factor x Occupancy factor..In the impugned judgment, Delhi High Court accepted the submission of the assessees holding that the impugned Bye-laws are ultra vires the NDMC Act as they are far beyond the scope and ambit of the powers vested in NDMC under Section 388(1)(A)(9) of the Act which gives rule making power to the NDMC.SC observed that these Bye-law were framed in the year 2009 and they were struck down by the High Court vide impugned judgment dated 10th August, 2017. That at present, 95% of the assessees have paid their tax as per Byelaws 2009. In these circumstances, to upset the applecart completely may not be appropriate. In such a peculiar situation, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Apex Court directs that those assessees who have paid the tax as per Bye-Laws, 2009, their assessments shall not be reopened. However, it will not apply to the respondents namely, those assessees who were the writ petitioners in the High Court. In their cases, the direction given by the High Court in the impugned judgment shall prevail.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect title. There will always be some risk of litigation, even if the title is clear.The best way to protect yourself from future problems is to purchase title insurance. Title insurance will protect you from financial losses if there are any defects in your title that are not revealed by the title search.As for your specific question, it is impossible to say for sure whether your documents will be complete and acceptable to a future buyer without knowing more about the property and the chain of title.

Under theHindu Succession Act, 1956, daughters have equal rights to property as sons.

Subsequently, the property was mutated into your name, and you have obtained patta and passbook for the property.If the property was gifted to you through a registered Will, then the disposition of the property will be governed by the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act states that any property which is bequeathed by a Will takes effect upon the death of the testator. Therefore, upon your father's death, the gift of the property through the Will will become operational.If the property has already been mutated in your name and you have obtained the necessary documents and records, it would be difficult for your uncles to challenge the mutation or seek re-partition of the property. However, it is important to consult with a lawyer and thoroughly review the terms of the Will to ensure that all legal aspects have been properly followed.In case your uncles challenge the validity of the Will or your right to the property, you may need to approach a civil court to seek a declaration of your rights and protection of your interests.

How to know whether someone is declared a proclaimed offender or not you must note that casually terming someone as a proclaimed offender and declaration of someone as a proclaimed offender is two different things. While a person can be claimed to be a regular offender by general public only on the basis that he/she has been absconding while to fulfill the conditions for later the court has to officially publish about the offender in a newspaper as well as the same should be affixeda a place where it can be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in which such person ordinarily resides. In short, if you think such publications has not been made in name of your mother and no such a fixation has been done... You can presume that your mother has not been declared a proclaimed offender by the court.And in reply to second query, even if your mother is declared a proclaimed offender by the court and for matter even not... You can still move a regular bail and there is no bar to the same.For further query you can connect with me and can avail legal services.Aarushi AjainAdvocate, Jammu6 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aarushi Ajain"

    "question": "Refund from builder - please help",
    "answer": "When a buyer pays cash to the seller in a real estate transaction, there can be several implications and penalties for the buyer. Here are some of the potential consequences:Tax Evasion:One of the most significant implications of paying cash is the possibility of tax evasion. Cash transactions can be used to conceal the actual purchase price and evade taxes. In India, real estate transactions are subject to stamp duty, registration charges, and capital gains tax. By paying in cash and not disclosing the actual amount, the buyer risks being involved in tax evasion, which is illegal.Non-Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Laws:Cash transactions can also raise concerns under anti-money laundering laws. In an effort to combat money laundering and other illegal activities, many countries have strict AML regulations in place. Paying large sums of cash without proper documentation may raise suspicions and could lead to investigations.Dispute Resolution Challenges:In case of disputes between the buyer and seller, it becomes difficult to prove the actual payment made if it was in cash. This lack of proper documentation can weaken the buyer's position in a legal dispute.Loan Approval Difficulties:When a buyer pays a significant amount in cash, it may affect the loan approval process. Banks and financial institutions usually require proper documentation of the entire transaction, including the down payment. If the buyer cannot demonstrate the source of funds for the cash payment, it may impact their loan eligibility or result in delays in loan processing.Impact on Property Valuation:Paying a significant amount in cash may artificially lower the registered sale price of the property. This can distort property valuation in the area and affect the property's resale value.Penalties and Fines:If the tax authorities discover a cash payment made by the buyer, penalties and fines may be imposed on the buyer for tax evasion and non-compliance with tax laws.It's important to note that cash transactions in real estate are generally discouraged and may have serious legal and financial implications. It is always advisable to conduct real estate transactions through proper banking channels and with complete documentation to ensure compliance with the law and protect the interests of all parties involved.Radha Raman RoyAdvocate, Patna3 AnswersTalk to Advocate Radha Raman Roy"

However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect title.

The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the ground that by introducing the Unit Area Method (UAM), these Bye-laws sought to alter the earlier system of determining the rateable value on the basis of the annual rent at which the land or buildings may reasonably be expected to be let from year to year....2) The ‘rateable value’, as per Section 2(42) of the NDMC Act is to be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Bye-laws made thereunder. Section 63(1) deals with determination of annual rent of a property. This annual rent has to be the one which the land or the property ‘might reasonably be expected to let from year to year’. It is, thus, based on the letting yearly value of the property. Based on various judgments of this Court, it was noticed that the only basis for fixation of rateable value is the annual rent at which the land or building might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, subject to the deductions provided under the NDMC Act...3) The Impugned Bye-laws that provide UAM, which is based on the annual value of the property, are foreign to the methodology provided in Section 63 of the NDMC Act.

The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the grounds that they violated the New Delhi Municipal Act, 1944 (NDMC Act).The NDMC Bye-Laws introduced a new method for determining the rateable value of properties, called the Unit Area Method (UAM). The UAM is based on the annual value of the property, rather than the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court found that the UAM was not in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act. The Act specifically states that the rateable value of a property is to be determined on the basis of the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court's decision means that the NDMC Bye-Laws will no longer be used to determine the rateable value of properties in Delhi.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to ensure the authenticity of a property's sale deed, it is crucial to have it registered with the appropriate registrar. Obtain certified copies of all sale deeds, especially the second sale deed, and thoroughly examine them for legitimacy. It is highly recommended to carry out a comprehensive due diligence process with the assistance of a competent advocate. Only proceed with the purchase if the advocate's report confirms the validity of the sale deed. It is important to note that obtaining a loan from a bank or publishing a public notice does not guarantee the title of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First, ascertain how the second sale deed went missing and satisfy yourself of the genuine reason. Was any FIR lodged and paper advertisement given for the missing deed earlier? If are satisfied, you may obtain a certified copy from the registry. Engage a competent lawyer to scrutinise all the title documents and obtain his/her written opinion. As the second owner bought the property in 1989, even by virtue of adverse possession, for argument's sake, he has clear title and ownership. Financial institutions should not hesitate to take the property under mortgage for a loan, if the title is otherwise clear, absolute and marketable.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "question": "One original sale deed of 1989 missing - not the latest",
    "answer": "The marketability of your title will depend on a number of factors, including the completeness of your title documents, the existence of any encumbrances on the property, and the zoning laws that apply to the property.If you have done your due diligence and have all of the necessary title documents, you are well on your way to having a marketable title. However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect title. There will always be some risk of litigation, even if the title is clear.The best way to protect yourself from future problems is to purchase title insurance. Title insurance will protect you from financial losses if there are any defects in your title that are not revealed by the title search.As for your specific question, it is impossible to say for sure whether your documents will be complete and acceptable to a future buyer without knowing more about the property and the chain of title. However, if you have done your due diligence and have all of the necessary documents, you are in a good position to have a marketable title.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Satish Chand vs Bhonrilal And Anr. on 6 February, 1991  of Rajasthan high court:It was held that it is true that the plaintiff in a suit is dominus litus and he cannot be made, against his consent, to fight a third party other than the defendant impleaded by him.It was also noted that it is true that it is not open to the High Court in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section115 C.P.C. to question a finding of fact, recorded by a subordinate court. It is also true that Section115 C.P.C. applies to cases involving questions of jurisdiction i.e. questions regarding irregular exercise or non-exercise of jurisdiction or illegal assumption of jurisdiction by a court and not against anordereven though it is not perfectly legal or justified. It is further true that it is not competent for the High Court to correct even errors of fact or errors of law unless the said errors have relation to the jurisdiction of the court to decide the dispute. After the amendment in Section115 CPC the High Court cannot interfere in revisional jurisdiction unless the impugnedorder, if allowed to stand, would occasion a failure of justice or shall cause irreparable injury to the party against whom it was made and therefore, it is necessary for us to examine the facts of the case.Thus the court held that the revision against the orders passed by trial court an IA filed under order 1 rule 10 cpc is maintainable.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

How to know whether someone is declared a proclaimed offender or not you must note that casually terming someone as a proclaimed offender and declaration of someone as a proclaimed offender is two different things. While a person can be claimed to be a regular offender by general public only on the basis that he/she has been absconding while to fulfill the conditions for later the court has to officially publish about the offender in a newspaper as well as the same should be affixeda a place where it can be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in which such person ordinarily resides. In short, if you think such publications has not been made in name of your mother and no such a fixation has been done... You can presume that your mother has not been declared a proclaimed offender by the court.And in reply to second query, even if your mother is declared a proclaimed offender by the court and for matter even not... You can still move a regular bail and there is no bar to the same.For further query you can connect with me and can avail legal services.Aarushi AjainAdvocate, Jammu6 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aarushi Ajain"

The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the ground that by introducing the Unit Area Method (UAM), these Bye-laws sought to alter the earlier system of determining the rateable value on the basis of the annual rent at which the land or buildings may reasonably be expected to be let from year to year....2) The ‘rateable value’, as per Section 2(42) of the NDMC Act is to be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Bye-laws made thereunder. Section 63(1) deals with determination of annual rent of a property. This annual rent has to be the one which the land or the property ‘might reasonably be expected to let from year to year’. It is, thus, based on the letting yearly value of the property. Based on various judgments of this Court, it was noticed that the only basis for fixation of rateable value is the annual rent at which the land or building might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, subject to the deductions provided under the NDMC Act...3) The Impugned Bye-laws that provide UAM, which is based on the annual value of the property, are foreign to the methodology provided in Section 63 of the NDMC Act.

The NDMC Bye-Laws were challenged on the grounds that they violated the New Delhi Municipal Act, 1944 (NDMC Act).The NDMC Bye-Laws introduced a new method for determining the rateable value of properties, called the Unit Area Method (UAM). The UAM is based on the annual value of the property, rather than the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court found that the UAM was not in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act. The Act specifically states that the rateable value of a property is to be determined on the basis of the annual rent at which it could be reasonably expected to be let from year to year.The High Court's decision means that the NDMC Bye-Laws will no longer be used to determine the rateable value of properties in Delhi. The rateable value of properties will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the NDMC Act.The NDMC Bye-Laws were in force from 2009 to 2017.

However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect title. There will always be some risk of litigation, even if the title is clear.The best way to protect yourself from future problems is to purchase title insurance. Title insurance will protect you from financial losses if there are any defects in your title that are not revealed by the title search.As for your specific question, it is impossible to say for sure whether your documents will be complete and acceptable to a future buyer without knowing more about the property and the chain of title.

    "question": "Permission for sale of house",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Government servants are required to obtain permission from their department before selling any immovable property.This includes property owned by the government servant themselves, as well as property owned by any member of their family.If a government servant fails to obtain permission before selling property, they may be subject to disciplinary action.This could include a warning, suspension, or even dismissal from their job.The reason for this rule is to prevent government servants from using their position to gain an unfair advantage in property transactions.For example, a government servant might be able to buy property at a below-market price if they know that a sale is coming up.The rule also helps to ensure that government servants are not involved in conflicts of interest.For example, a government servant who is responsible for approving property deals should not be able to sell property themselves.If you are a government servant and you are considering selling property, you should first contact your department to get permission.This will help to ensure that you are in compliance with the rules and that you avoid any potential disciplinary action.Here is a more concise version:Government servants must obtain permission from their department before selling any immovable property.Failure to do so could result in disciplinary action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- Since, the original sale deed is missing , then it can be a problem in future even after getting the certified copy of the same.- Hence, the seller should publish notice after mentioning that the original sale deed has been lost and the missing report is already issued by the police , and hence that sale deed holder will have no right over the property.- However, before publishing this notice , a complaint should be given to the police for missing and even it can be possible online as well.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to ensure the authenticity of a property's sale deed, it is crucial to have it registered with the appropriate registrar. Obtain certified copies of all sale deeds, especially the second sale deed, and thoroughly examine them for legitimacy. It is highly recommended to carry out a comprehensive due diligence process with the assistance of a competent advocate. Only proceed with the purchase if the advocate's report confirms the validity of the sale deed. It is important to note that obtaining a loan from a bank or publishing a public notice does not guarantee the title of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First, ascertain how the second sale deed went missing and satisfy yourself of the genuine reason. Was any FIR lodged and paper advertisement given for the missing deed earlier? If are satisfied, you may obtain a certified copy from the registry. Engage a competent lawyer to scrutinise all the title documents and obtain his/her written opinion. As the second owner bought the property in 1989, even by virtue of adverse possession, for argument's sake, he has clear title and ownership. Financial institutions should not hesitate to take the property under mortgage for a loan, if the title is otherwise clear, absolute and marketable.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "answer": "The marketability of your title will depend on a number of factors, including the completeness of your title documents, the existence of any encumbrances on the property, and the zoning laws that apply to the property.If you have done your due diligence and have all of the necessary title documents, you are well on your way to having a marketable title. However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect title. There will always be some risk of litigation, even if the title is clear.The best way to protect yourself from future problems is to purchase title insurance. Title insurance will protect you from financial losses if there are any defects in your title that are not revealed by the title search.As for your specific question, it is impossible to say for sure whether your documents will be complete and acceptable to a future buyer without knowing more about the property and the chain of title. However, if you have done your due diligence and have all of the necessary documents, you are in a good position to have a marketable title.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund from builder - please help",
    "answer": "When a buyer pays cash to the seller in a real estate transaction, there can be several implications and penalties for the buyer. Here are some of the potential consequences:Tax Evasion:One of the most significant implications of paying cash is the possibility of tax evasion. Cash transactions can be used to conceal the actual purchase price and evade taxes. In India, real estate transactions are subject to stamp duty, registration charges, and capital gains tax. By paying in cash and not disclosing the actual amount, the buyer risks being involved in tax evasion, which is illegal.Non-Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Laws:Cash transactions can also raise concerns under anti-money laundering laws. In an effort to combat money laundering and other illegal activities, many countries have strict AML regulations in place. Paying large sums of cash without proper documentation may raise suspicions and could lead to investigations.Dispute Resolution Challenges:In case of disputes between the buyer and seller, it becomes difficult to prove the actual payment made if it was in cash. This lack of proper documentation can weaken the buyer's position in a legal dispute.Loan Approval Difficulties:When a buyer pays a significant amount in cash, it may affect the loan approval process. Banks and financial institutions usually require proper documentation of the entire transaction, including the down payment. If the buyer cannot demonstrate the source of funds for the cash payment, it may impact their loan eligibility or result in delays in loan processing.Impact on Property Valuation:Paying a significant amount in cash may artificially lower the registered sale price of the property. This can distort property valuation in the area and affect the property's resale value.Penalties and Fines:If the tax authorities discover a cash payment made by the buyer, penalties and fines may be imposed on the buyer for tax evasion and non-compliance with tax laws.It's important to note that cash transactions in real estate are generally discouraged and may have serious legal and financial implications. It is always advisable to conduct real estate transactions through proper banking channels and with complete documentation to ensure compliance with the law and protect the interests of all parties involved.Radha Raman RoyAdvocate, Patna3 AnswersTalk to Advocate Radha Raman Roy"

    "answer": "Hi sir,In Reply to your first query, I.e. How to know whether someone is declared a proclaimed offender or not you must note that casually terming someone as a proclaimed offender and declaration of someone as a proclaimed offender is two different things. While a person can be claimed to be a regular offender by general public only on the basis that he/she has been absconding while to fulfill the conditions for later the court has to officially publish about the offender in a newspaper as well as the same should be affixeda a place where it can be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in which such person ordinarily resides. In short, if you think such publications has not been made in name of your mother and no such a fixation has been done... You can presume that your mother has not been declared a proclaimed offender by the court.And in reply to second query, even if your mother is declared a proclaimed offender by the court and for matter even not... You can still move a regular bail and there is no bar to the same.For further query you can connect with me and can avail legal services.Aarushi AjainAdvocate, Jammu6 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aarushi Ajain"

    "answer": "The marketability of your title will depend on a number of factors, including the completeness of your title documents, the existence of any encumbrances on the property, and the zoning laws that apply to the property.If you have done your due diligence and have all of the necessary title documents, you are well on your way to having a marketable title. However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect title. There will always be some risk of litigation, even if the title is clear.The best way to protect yourself from future problems is to purchase title insurance. Title insurance will protect you from financial losses if there are any defects in your title that are not revealed by the title search.As for your specific question, it is impossible to say for sure whether your documents will be complete and acceptable to a future buyer without knowing more about the property and the chain of title. However, if you have done your due diligence and have all of the necessary documents, you are in a good position to have a marketable title.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is also true that Section115 C.P.C. applies to cases involving questions of jurisdiction i.e. questions regarding irregular exercise or non-exercise of jurisdiction or illegal assumption of jurisdiction by a court and not against anordereven though it is not perfectly legal or justified. It is further true that it is not competent for the High Court to correct even errors of fact or errors of law unless the said errors have relation to the jurisdiction of the court to decide the dispute. After the amendment in Section115 CPC the High Court cannot interfere in revisional jurisdiction unless the impugnedorder, if allowed to stand, would occasion a failure of justice or shall cause irreparable injury to the party against whom it was made and therefore, it is necessary for us to examine the facts of the case.Thus the court held that the revision against the orders passed by trial court an IA filed under order 1 rule 10 cpc is maintainable.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

How to know whether someone is declared a proclaimed offender or not you must note that casually terming someone as a proclaimed offender and declaration of someone as a proclaimed offender is two different things. While a person can be claimed to be a regular offender by general public only on the basis that he/she has been absconding while to fulfill the conditions for later the court has to officially publish about the offender in a newspaper as well as the same should be affixeda a place where it can be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in which such person ordinarily resides. In short, if you think such publications has not been made in name of your mother and no such a fixation has been done... You can presume that your mother has not been declared a proclaimed offender by the court.And in reply to second query, even if your mother is declared a proclaimed offender by the court and for matter even not...

    "answer": "When a buyer pays cash to the seller in a real estate transaction, there can be several implications and penalties for the buyer. Here are some of the potential consequences:Tax Evasion:One of the most significant implications of paying cash is the possibility of tax evasion. Cash transactions can be used to conceal the actual purchase price and evade taxes. In India, real estate transactions are subject to stamp duty, registration charges, and capital gains tax. By paying in cash and not disclosing the actual amount, the buyer risks being involved in tax evasion, which is illegal.Non-Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Laws:Cash transactions can also raise concerns under anti-money laundering laws. In an effort to combat money laundering and other illegal activities, many countries have strict AML regulations in place. Paying large sums of cash without proper documentation may raise suspicions and could lead to investigations.Dispute Resolution Challenges:In case of disputes between the buyer and seller, it becomes difficult to prove the actual payment made if it was in cash. This lack of proper documentation can weaken the buyer's position in a legal dispute.Loan Approval Difficulties:When a buyer pays a significant amount in cash, it may affect the loan approval process. Banks and financial institutions usually require proper documentation of the entire transaction, including the down payment. If the buyer cannot demonstrate the source of funds for the cash payment, it may impact their loan eligibility or result in delays in loan processing.Impact on Property Valuation:Paying a significant amount in cash may artificially lower the registered sale price of the property. This can distort property valuation in the area and affect the property's resale value.Penalties and Fines:If the tax authorities discover a cash payment made by the buyer, penalties and fines may be imposed on the buyer for tax evasion and non-compliance with tax laws.It's important to note that cash transactions in real estate are generally discouraged and may have serious legal and financial implications. It is always advisable to conduct real estate transactions through proper banking channels and with complete documentation to ensure compliance with the law and protect the interests of all parties involved.Radha Raman RoyAdvocate, Patna3 AnswersTalk to Advocate Radha Raman Roy"
