    return """⚖️ **Void Agreement vs Voidable Contract - Indian Contract Act, 1872**

📘 **Key Differences**:

## 🚫 **VOID AGREEMENT**
**Definition**: An agreement that is not enforceable by law from the very beginning.

**Legal Provisions**: Sections 2(g), 24-30 of Indian Contract Act, 1872

**Characteristics**:
• **Ab initio void**: Invalid from the beginning
• **No legal effect**: Cannot be enforced by any party
• **Cannot be ratified**: No legal remedy available
• **Examples**: Agreement with minor, agreement without consideration, agreement for illegal purpose

**Key Sections**:
• Section 11: Agreements with minors are void
• Section 23: Agreements with unlawful object/consideration are void
• Section 25: Agreements without consideration are void (with exceptions)

## ✅ **VOIDABLE CONTRACT**
**Definition**: A contract that is valid but can be avoided at the option of one party.

**Legal Provisions**: Section 2(i), 19, 19A of Indian Contract Act, 1872

**Characteristics**:
• **Valid until avoided**: Enforceable until one party chooses to avoid
• **Option to avoid**: Aggrieved party can choose to continue or avoid
• **Can be ratified**: Party can confirm the contract despite grounds for avoidance
• **Examples**: Contract induced by coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation

**Key Sections**:
• Section 19: Contracts caused by coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, or undue influence are voidable
• Section 19A: Contracts caused by mistake of fact are voidable

## 📊 **Comparison Table**:

| Aspect | Void Agreement | Voidable Contract |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Validity** | Invalid from beginning | Valid until avoided |
| **Enforceability** | Never enforceable | Enforceable until avoided |
| **Legal Effect** | No legal consequences | Legal consequences until avoided |
| **Ratification** | Not possible | Possible |
| **Restitution** | Generally not available | Available to aggrieved party |

## 💼 **Practical Examples**:

**Void Agreement Example**:
- A, aged 16, enters into a contract to sell his property to B
- This is void ab initio under Section 11 (minor's agreement)

**Voidable Contract Example**:
- A threatens B to enter into a contract (coercion)
- B can choose to avoid the contract under Section 19

## 🏛️ **Case Law**:
• **Mohori Bibee vs Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**: Minor's agreement is void ab initio
• **Chinnaya vs Ramayya (1882)**: Natural love and affection can be valid consideration
